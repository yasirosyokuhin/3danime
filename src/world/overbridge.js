/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * 跨線橋 -- the pedestrian overbridge.
 *
 * The district had no vertical viewpoint at all: everything was seen from
 * eye height on flat ground, and the railway -- the thing the whole place is
 * organised around -- could only ever be looked at from beside it.  From
 * 7.2 m up you look *down* the track: the platform and its canopy in the
 * middle distance, the level crossing beyond it, the lineside cherries in
 * plan, the shop roofs to the north, and the train passing underneath.
 *
 * Three things fix the geometry, and all three are worth knowing before
 * moving anything.
 *
 *  - **The deck height is set by the catenary, not by taste.**  The messenger
 *    wire runs at 5.95 m and the contact wire at 4.88 (`railway.js`), so the
 *    soffit has to clear 5.95 with something to spare.  Deck at 7.20, slab
 *    0.28, girders 0.60 deep -> the lowest steel is at 6.32, which is 0.37
 *    over the messenger.  That is what makes this a 40-riser climb; a shorter
 *    bridge would be a bridge through the wires.
 *
 *  - **`heightAt` is single-valued**, so no two walkable levels can share a
 *    footprint.  That rules out the compact form where a flight doubles back
 *    directly over the one below it: the player standing underneath would be
 *    lifted onto the flight above.  Both towers are therefore *quarter*-turns
 *    -- flight, corner landing, flight at ninety degrees -- which never
 *    overlap in plan.  Everything that *is* overhead (the deck ends, the head
 *    landings, the upper flights) has its undercroft closed off with a
 *    collider, which is also what a real stair tower does.
 *
 *  - **x = 41 is the only place both banks are clear.**  The near side is
 *    boxed in by 青空商店 (to x = 12), a house at x 15.8-24.2 and another at
 *    26.6-34.4; the far side by the platform (x 15.4-38.1) and the row of
 *    background houses at z -9 to -19.  East of the platform both banks open
 *    out at once, and it is still inside the 51 m ground horizon from deck
 *    eye height, so the crossing reads.
