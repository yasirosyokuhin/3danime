   * wide enough to read as an opening from the alley, a fifth of what a body
   * needs to get through it, and the whole passage was a dead end because of
   * it.  Each run ends in a pier at the opening, because 3 m of concrete
   * stopping in mid-air reads as a card standing on the paving.
   *
   * There is no grade to retain across the opening: the ground west of the wall
