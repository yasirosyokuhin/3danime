/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * ひばり台四丁目 -- the quiet family district north of the library.
 *
 * Two things make this a *community* rather than an estate, and everything
 * else here is arranged around them: the neighbourhood association hall and
 * the pocket park.  The hall's notices, its folded tables and its eight parked
 * bicycles are how you say people organise here without putting anybody in the
 * frame; an empty small park at four in the afternoon does more for the mood of
 * a place than any architecture.
 *
 * The land is the whole design problem, so it is worth writing down.  The
 * envelope is x 1..30, z 49..80, and by the time this block runs almost all of
 * it is already spoken for -- ひばり台図書館 (x 10.9..20.7, z 50.5..57.7), its
 * forecourt, the corner cluster, **米・酒 なかの (x 1.95..7.05, z 49.15..54.65)**,
 * ひばり台コーポ and its open stair (x 22.6..30.1 down to z 64.0), the coin
 * parking, and the lanes this block lays.  The shop is in bold because the
 * first draft of this list left it out, and a list of what the land is spoken
 * for is worth nothing if it is not complete: the lane went through the shop,
 * the lamp pole stood in its shop floor, the boundary hedge went in a 0.65 m
 * slot, and the block was reachable only through a 0.49 m pinch.  See `LN_Z0`.
 * What is left is *two strips*:
 *
 *   zone A   x 8.8..22.6, z 57.7..68.3 -- 10.6 m deep, between the library's
 *            north wall and the east arm.  Deep enough for one building with a
 *            forecourt in front of it, which is exactly what a hall needs.
 *   the north parcel  x 1..30, z 71.6..80 -- 8.4 m deep, north of the arm.
 *            Deep enough for one row of dwellings with a front garden and
 *            nothing else, so this is where the housing goes.
 *
 * That arithmetic is why there are three buildings here and not eight.  A
 * `makeHall` cannot be narrower than about 9.05 m (below that its own window
 * run collides with its notice case -- see `porchAt` below), so it does not fit
 * across the north parcel in any orientation, and a terrace with parking bays
 * needs 6.2 + 4.6 = 10.8 m of depth, which only zone A has.  The hall takes
 * zone A; the north parcel takes a small walk-up, a 二階半 house, a carport bay
 * and the park.  Everything else in the envelope is a *gap*, and the gaps are
 * doing as much work as the buildings: a drying ground behind the コーポ, an
 * allotment and a tin store in a break in the west hedge, a vegetable bed and
 * a shared tap down the side slot, a thicket closing the arm.
 *
 * **The library's west flank is load-bearing composition** (NEXT.md records it),
 * so there is no building west of x = 8 between z = 49 and z = 62 -- that
 * stretch is dressed instead, with a hedge, a long bed, two street cherries in
 * pits, a bench and two lamps.  The lane's east side is built and its west side
 * is open, so the walk north is asymmetric, and the long view is the lane
 * itself: 22 m of it, closing on the park's railing and its three cherries.
 *
 * This is the kept street of the new work, so it gets what a kept street has:
 * edge lines, a gutter and its manholes, tree pits, three lamps on poles with
 * their cabling, a name plate at the mouth, a mirror at the junction and kerbs
 * on the arm.  The back lanes elsewhere deliberately have none of that.
 *
 * FLOODFILL -- every one of these must be reachable on foot from the spawn:
 *   [-3.4, 55.0]  the main road's last stretch, north of where street.js stops
 *   [-3.4, 58.9]  the road head, behind the barrier's footway return
 *   [2.0, 56.9]   the arm, at the T
 *   [6.0, 57.0]   the corner where the arm turns into the lane
 *   [8.2, 56.6]   なかの's back yard, in through the lane's south end
 *   [6.0, 66.4]   the lane beside the hall's flank and its notice board
 *   [6.1, 70.0]   the junction of the lane and the east arm
 *   [12.0, 66.0]  the hall's porch, on its slab under the canopy
 *   [15.4, 67.4]  the hall's forecourt, under the bike shelter
 *   [20.2, 66.6]  the association's two car bays
 *   [25.4, 66.0]  the コーポ's drying ground, through its gate
 *   [26.4, 70.0]  the east arm's far end, at the thicket
 *   [5.6, 76.2]   the middle of the pocket park
 *   [3.0, 76.8]   the park's children's bicycle shelter.  Was [3.0, 73.2]; the
 *                 park's south-west corner is ひばり台七丁目's link lane now and
 *                 the shelter moved north with it -- see `buildPark`.
 *   [2.60, 73.90] the link lane, at the park's new corner
 *   [14.0, 72.3]  ハイツ ひばり's frontage strip
 *   [23.0, 72.7]  the 二階半's front garden, in through its gate at x 25.4
 *   [20.3, 76.5]  the utility slot between the two, with the bed and the tap
 *   [28.3, 71.4]  the approach to the carport bay at the east end of the row.
 *                 Was [28.3, 74.0], which is under the carport itself -- and
 *                 there is a car parked in it now (`traffic.js`), so the probe
 *                 moved to the ground in front of it.  A bay with a vehicle in
 *                 it is not walkable and is not meant to be.
