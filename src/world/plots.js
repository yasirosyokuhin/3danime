 * Plots, boundaries and the things that say somebody lives here.
 *
 * Six new residential blocks went in at once, and the previous rounds are very
 * clear about where the bugs in work like this actually are.  They are never in
 * the buildings.  They are in the ground around them:
 *
 *   - a prop placed by its clearance to a wall rather than by its own length,
 *     so half of it is inside the render (thirty-seven of eighty-seven bicycles)
 *   - a prop turned to face the building it belongs to instead of the street
 *     (half the outdoor units in the world, fans pointing into the wall)
 *   - a prop seated from `groundY(z)` when a footway, a slab or a cut is under
 *     it, so it floats or is buried by exactly that thickness
 *   - a boundary wall standing in the lane because the plot had no setback
 *   - an offset given in the unit's frame and applied in world space, which for
 *     a building turned a half circle puts everything on the wrong side
 *
 * Every one of those is a *frame* problem, so this file owns the frames.
 * `plotBox` turns a building's own `{x, z, w, d, face}` -- the same numbers you
 * handed the generator -- into a world AABB plus an `at(u, v)` that maps the
 * unit's local axes into world space.  Nothing in the six blocks does that
 * arithmetic by hand, and `dressPlot` places the whole life of a house through
 * it: correct side, correct facing, seated on `ctx.groundAt`, and never twice in
 * the same place.
