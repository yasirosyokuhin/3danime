/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * ひばり山 -- the back-hill district.
 *
 * The twenty-fifth district, and the first one that is *land* rather than a place
 * or a street: forty thousand square metres of hill, of which about a fifth is
 * within walking distance of the school's back gate.  `hills.js` makes the ground
 * and the trails; this module is everything a hill has on it when a town has been
 * using it for eighty years.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * THE THREE THINGS IT HAS TO GET RIGHT
 *
 * **It has to be reachable, and the school is the way in.**  The school's north
 * wall was at z = -74 and the ground behind it was empty field; it is at -86 now
 * with a 裏門 in it at x = 18, and the whole district hangs off that gate.  In
 * between is the 裾道 -- the hill-foot road -- which is what makes the back of the
 * school a *place* rather than the edge of the model, and it is also the only way
 * anything with wheels reaches the hill.
 *
 * **It has to be maintained, not wild.**  The brief was explicit and it is the
 * harder half: a hill with a path on it and nothing else reads as abandoned.  So
 * there are cut logs across the steep pitches, a gutter where the trail crosses a
 * drainage line, fingerposts at every junction with real distances on them, a
 * tool store and a flood box at the trail head, chalk on the concrete, a
 * strimmed edge along the road, and a shrine somebody still leaves water at.  The
 * measure of it is that every one of those has a reason to be where it is.
 *
 * **Nothing may be steeper than the ground it is on.**  `hillPath` hands back the
 * measured gradient of every leg, and the log steps go where *that* says rather
 * than where a hand-written list says -- two pitches on the main climb, at 0.42
 * and 0.34.  Write the list by hand and it goes stale the moment a summit moves
 * four metres, which is exactly what happened three times while the field was
 * being tuned.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * FLOODFILL -- every one of these must be reachable on foot from the spawn.
