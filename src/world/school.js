/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * 県立ひばり台高等学校 -- the high school on the rise behind the station.
 *
 * The site sits at the far end of the main street, where `groundY` has
 * already climbed its full 1.05 m, so the street itself is the 通学路: walk
 * north from the crossing and the road lifts you to the school gate.  That
 * is the whole reason the school is here and not somewhere flatter.
 *
 * Composition rules the layout obeys:
 *
 *  - The gate faces the street, and the 3-storey block faces the gate, so
 *    the approach is a single straight axis with sakura down both sides.
 *  - The block is a *shell*, not a solid box.  Its west facade is built as
 *    piers and spandrels with real holes, and the classroom interiors sit
 *    behind them -- modelling it as a solid volume with a glass decal is
 *    what makes school windows read as stickers.
 *  - Interiors are unlit `flat()` material knocked back toward violet.  A
 *    cel-shaded interior inside a shell is in the roof's shadow, and comes
 *    out muddy brown.
 *  - The block's top three metres (bell housing, roof railing, water tank)
 *    are the only part visible from the crossing 50 m away, so they carry
 *    the silhouette and get the most attention.
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ */

/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * THE EXPANSION -- what doubled, and what did not.
 *
 * The site was x 10.6..56, z -41..-74: 45.4 x 33 = 1 498 m².  It is now
 * x 10.6..84, z -41..-86 -- **73.4 x 45 = 3 303 m², 2.2 times the old one** --
 * and the growth is all east and north, because those are the only two directions
 * with anything in them.  West is the 通学路 and its footway, and south is
 * 川端の道 and the drainage channel eight metres beyond it.
 *
 * What is deliberately unchanged: the gate at (10.6, -49.5), the three-storey
 * 本校舎 at x 24.5..34 / z -68..-46, and the 昇降口 projecting west from the middle
 * of it.  Those three are the whole approach sequence -- the street lifts you to
 * the gate, the gate faces the block, the block's entrance closes the axis -- and
 * every camera position in `CLAUDE.md` that mentions the school is one of them.
 * A doubling that moves the front door is a rebuild, not an expansion.
 *
 * What moved: **the gymnasium**, from x 37..54 / z -73.5..-63.5 to the site's new
 * north-east corner, 20 x 14 instead of 17 x 10.  It had to: it stood squarely in
 * the middle of the new site, between the second block and the ground, and there
 * is no arrangement of a 22 m teaching block, a 44 m ground and a courtyard that
 * works round a gym in the centre of the plot.  Moving it is what freed the land
 * for the 中庭, which is the thing the brief actually asked for.
 *
 * The order of the plan, west to east: the approach and its yards; the two
 * teaching blocks with the 渡り廊下 between them; the courtyard; the ground; the
 * gym.  Four zones, and nothing in the middle of anything else.

 * of different rooms rather than as a repeat, which is the difference between a
 * second block and a copy of the first.
 *
 * Its long axis runs along X and its windows face +z, so unlike the main block --
 * whose facade looks west into the afternoon -- this one is lit all day.  That is
 * why it is the north building: the sun is at (-52, 62, 56), so a +z elevation is
