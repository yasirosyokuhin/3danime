/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * ひばり湖畔 -- the places round the lake.
 *
 * The twenty-sixth district.  `lakeform.js` shapes the basin, `hills.js` builds
 * the ground, `lake.js` is the water and `lakeroad.js` is the road, the dam and
 * the way over the hill.  This is the eight rooms.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * WHAT DECIDED WHERE EVERYTHING WENT
 *
 * **The sun.**  It is at (-52, 62, 56), so a face whose normal has -x or +z in it
 * is lit and one with +x or -z is in shade, every hour of the day.  That single
 * fact placed four of the eight:
 *
 *   - 喫茶 みなも is on the **south** shore facing north over the water, because a
 *     cafe terrace is the one thing here that must be lit *and* looking at the
 *     lake, and north is the only bearing that is both.
 *   - 貸ボート ひばり is on the **west** shore, so its frontage and its boats are
 *     seen from the cafe's terrace across thirty metres of water -- which is the
 *     one shot the brief asks for by name.
 *   - the 野鳥観察小屋 looks **north-west** over the reed flat, so the birds are
 *     between you and the light and the reeds are rim-lit.
 *   - and the far shore -- the north and the east -- gets **nothing built on it at
 *     all**, because it is the backdrop in every frame taken from the other three
 *     and a building over there would be in all of them.
 *
 * **The curvature.**  From a 1.7 m eye the water surface is visible for 23 m and
 * no further, so every viewpoint here has something of known size inside that
 * radius: the 桟橋's own piles, the boat house's hulls, the reed bed, the
 * peninsula.  A viewpoint whose nearest object is the far shore is a viewpoint of
 * haze.
 *
 * **And the shelf.**  `lakeform.js` gives the west shore a 15 m graded bank at
 * 0.20 and the reed flat a 26 m one at 0.10; everything else is the hillside's own
 * toe.  So the park is on the west shore because that is the only stretch of
 * ground flat enough to put a lawn on, and the campsite is on terraced platforms
 * because the shelf it stands on is 1-in-4 and no amount of wishing changes that.

/**
 * A plank deck on piles.
 *
 * Used by the 桟橋, the boat station's 浮桟橋, the reed-bay boardwalk, the cafe's
 * terrace and the campsite's tent platforms -- five things that are the same
 * object at different sizes, so they are one function.
 *
 * Three things it gets right that a box would not:
 *
 *   - **the piles reach the ground they are actually standing on.**  Each one is
 *     drawn from the deck down to `hillMeshY` at its own foot, which under water
 *     is the bed.  A deck on piles of one length is a deck floating over a bed
 *     that slopes, and the ink pass draws every one of them.
 *   - **the boards run across.**  A deck's planks are perpendicular to the way you
 *     walk, always, and at this tonal range the row of shadow gaps between them is
 *     most of what says "timber" rather than "grey slab".
 *   - **it registers a platform**, which is what actually carries the player;
 *     `heightAt` takes the max over platforms and knows nothing about geometry.
 *
 * `ry` turns the whole thing about its centre.  `w` is across, `d` along.

 *
 *   **26 m**, because the water surface is visible for 23 m from a 1.7 m eye -- so
 *   from the platform the whole of the *near* basin is inside the horizon and the
 *   peninsula's tip, 22 m further on, sits exactly on it.  A shorter pier and you
 *   are looking at haze; a longer one and the shore behind you is over the curve.
 *
 *   **0.55 m above the water**, which is derived from `ctx.groundAt` at the root
 *   rather than chosen: the shore there is `LEVEL + 0.20·s`, so a deck any higher
 *   needs a step at its root, and a step at the root of a pier is where everybody
 *   trips.  As built it is 0.23 m up from the path, inside the 0.38 m the player
 *   steps for free.
 *
 *   **2.4 m**, which is wide enough for the railing not to be the whole object and
