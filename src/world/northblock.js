/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * The north block -- ひばり台三丁目.
 *
 * The district's housing was twenty-five detached houses and one walk-up, and
 * that is not what a Japanese suburb looks like: it looks like five or six
 * *types* interleaved, because the plots were sold off at different times to
 * different buyers.  So this block is deliberately one of each, on one lane:
 *
 *   米・酒 なかの     a corner shop with the family's flat over it, on the main
 *                    road where the north lane meets it
 *   coin parking      relocated here off the shopping street (see below)
 *   the lane          3.2 m, no kerbs, one lamp, poles down one side
 *   二階半の家        the attic house, its dormer the tallest thing on the lane
 *   ひばり台コーポ    a three-storey walk-up, gallery and open stair on the lane
 *   連棟 三戸         a terrace of three, each with a bay in front of it
 *   片流れの平屋      a single-storey house under one falling roof
 *
 * They are all on one 3.2 m lane off the north end of the shopping street, and
 * the lane is the point: it is the first street in the world that is *only*
 * residential, so it has no shopfronts, no signage and nothing to look at
 * except how people live -- which is exactly the brief.
 *
 * **The coin parking moved here from the shopping street**, where it occupied
 * the six metres of frontage between そうざい and the north junction.  That was
 * the only spare frontage on either row, and the brief asked for two Showa
 * units in the street itself; a car park is a far better neighbour for a
 * library forecourt and a residential lane than it was for a run of shops, and
 * "a gap in a shopping street needs a reason" is now supplied by the two old
 * shops instead.  See `showa.js`.
