/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * 公園前 -- the housing that puts 児童公園 and ひばり荘 *inside* a
 * neighbourhood instead of beside one.
 *
 * The smallest of the six blocks and the one that carries the most connective
 * work.  Everything east of the crossing used to be a line of set pieces you
 * arrived at one at a time and left the same way: the lineside path ran out at
 * the overbridge, the park could only be entered from the west, and the walk-up
 * was a building you looked at across grass.  What this block builds is the
 * **link** -- a 2.2 m footway north off the lineside path, past the overbridge's
 * west piers, then east along the strip between the park's south railing and the
 * bridge's north end to meet block 2's spine at x = 47.3 -- and a second,
 * quieter one up ひばり荘's service flank to the north lane.  Between them those
 * two turn a line of districts into a loop.
 *
 * Three envelopes, none wider than five metres, so this block is about *edges*
 * rather than mass: the park railing, the overbridge's piers and undercroft,
 * ひばり荘's flank, and the one frontage there is room for.
 *
 *   (a) south of the park   x 34.5..47.3, z 6.0..17.2   -- split by the bridge
 *   (b) north of the park   x 31.9..47.3, z 30.8..34.9  -- the pocket square
 *   (c) east of ひばり荘    x 42.9..47.3, z 35.0..43.4  -- the flats' back
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * Three things about (a) that the arithmetic decided rather than taste, because
 * all three look like omissions until you measure them.
 *
 * **There is no terrace here, and there could not be.**  The bridge occupies
 * x 39.70..42.60 through the whole of (a) -- head landing, flight, corner
 * landing -- so the buildable west sub-piece is x 34.5..39.7, and the house next
 * door already has its own roof over the first 0.4 m of that (its eave reaches
 * x 34.82 at 5.44 m).  That leaves a 4.9 m roof envelope.  A `makeTerrace` of
 * two units at 2.9 m is 5.8 m of frontage and 6.52 m of roof; even at 2.4 m
 * units it is 5.52 m, and both put the east eave inside the flight, whose soffit
 * has dropped below terrace-ridge height by z = 7.2.  Nothing throws -- it is a
 * roof inside a staircase, the `makeTerrace`-shaped version of the 格子 panels
 * that were inside the wall on the onsen street.  So the west sub-piece takes
 * the *footway* and the block's one dwelling goes east of the bridge, where a
 * low building fits.
 *
 * **The dwelling is a 木造平屋, and it faces west.**  The east strip is 4.7 m of
 * usable width and 6.4 m of depth with the second flight coming down over its
 * northern 2.4 m, so the only thing that fits is single-storey and shallow in
 * plan: `makeTimberHouse` at w 5.2 / d 3.6 with the eave cut to 0.6 sits inside
 * it with 0.35 m to spare under the stair balustrade.  Facing 'x-' it is sunlit
 * (the sun is at -52/62/56), its 玄関 lands on the centre line of the 私道 that
 * serves it, and it is seen from the footway framed between the bridge's piers
 * and under its soffit -- which is the strongest picture available out here.
 * Its 縁側 goes on the south flank looking over the railway; the north flank is
 * under the stair and cannot carry one.
 *
 * **The car park is one bay, and it is under the bridge because that is the only
 * place a car fits.**  The court is 3.55 m across and 2.95 m deep between the
 * spur and the corner landing's platform -- shorter than a kei car -- so the bay
 * runs *north* out of the spur and borrows the spur's northern metre for its
 * nose-in.  Headroom over it is 3.2-5.7 m.  Everything else on the gravel is
 * two wheels.
