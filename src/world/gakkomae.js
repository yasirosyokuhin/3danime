/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * 学校前通り -- the 通学路 itself, from こばと橋 to the school gate.
 *
 * Every other district in this world is a *place*.  This one is the 35 m of
 * road between two of them, and the brief for it was the hardest one yet
 * because the answer is almost never a building: it is what a street has on it
 * when several hundred children walk down it twice a day.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * THE LAND, measured, and it is the reason this district is mostly street.
 *
 * The carriageway is x -0.15..6.15 with footways to -1.70 and 7.70, flat at
 * groundY 1.05 for every z south of -32.  Both sides are very nearly full:
 *
 *   west   house (-5.4,-33.5)      x -9.50..-1.30, z -37.30..-29.70
 *          五丁目's 送迎 bay        x -7.70..-2.70, z -40.50..-37.90
 *          五丁目's cross link      z -42.70..-40.10, x -20.80..-2.00
 *          ひばりマート             x -15.25..-7.95, z -52.55..-43.45, and its
 *                                   9.1 x 5.4 m apron in front of it
 *          五丁目's 抜け道          z -54.80..-52.80
 *          パン工房こむぎ           x -11.45..-4.95, z -60.55..-55.05
 *   east   house (14.4,-35.5)      x 10.90..17.90, z -39.20..-31.80
 *          the school's west wall   x 10.47..10.73, z -41.0..-74.0, with the
 *                                   gate opening at z -52.30..-46.10
 *          the canal's south kerb   z -30.20..-29.84, top 1.27, and the towpath
 *                                   behind it cut to 0.65 against a verge at 1.04
 *
 * That leaves exactly **two** parcels big enough to build on:
 *
 *   P4  x -11.4..-1.7, z -60.55..-65.0   9.7 x 4.45, on the road at the school
 *   P1  x -20.2..-11.4, z -55.0..-63.5   8.8 x 8.5, behind こむぎ, off 五丁目's
 *                                        lane, which already has a turning stub
 *                                        against it
 *
 * and a 2.77 m verge along the school wall, 24 m of it, which is too shallow
 * for anything with a roof and exactly the right depth for what a school
 * frontage actually is: bicycles, boards and signs.
 *
 * So: one shop on the road (P4), one on the lane (P1), and the rest of the work
 * is the street.  Anything more would have meant moving ひばりマート, こむぎ or
 * the school wall, and none of those is worth a shop.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * WHAT THE ARITHMETIC DECIDED
 *
 * **The towpath was unreachable from the bridge head.**  The canal's retaining
 * kerb is 0.62 m of concrete along z = -30.0 running x 7.9..44, and the bank
 * behind it sits 0.37 m below the road verge -- 0.62 m of collider above a
 * 0.38 m step limit, so from the pavement you could see the water and there was
 * no way down to it for forty metres either way.  `canal.js` now leaves a
 * 2.5 m opening at x 7.95..10.45 with a return each side, and the flight comes
 * through it.  Three treads at 0.125, because the whole drop is 0.375.
 *
 * **The bike park fills the verge and the footway carries the walking.**  A
 * nose-in rack needs 0.95 m clear of the render for half a wheelbase, which on
 * a 2.77 m verge leaves 0.98 m -- 0.30 m of walkable ground after the player's
 * own radius, i.e. none.  That is correct and not a problem: the road's own
 * 1.55 m footway is right beside it and is the route.  A Japanese school
 * frontage *is* a wall of bicycles with the pavement in front of it.
 *
 * **Nothing new stands in the middle of the carriageway's sight line.**  The
 * view up the hill from the crossing (`hill`, pos [1.5, 0, -22]) is the opening
 * composition of the whole project, and it looks straight along this road.
 * Everything added here is on a verge.
 *
 * FLOODFILL -- every one of these must be reachable on foot from the spawn:
 *   bridgeSq   [9.3, -32.4]   the 橋詰 square, east of the bridge's south end
 *   towpath    [9.3, -29.2]   the canal's south path, down the new flight
 *   stepsTop   [9.2, -31.2]   the head of the flight
 *   westCorner [-3.2, -28.6]  the west triangle, its mirror and refuse point
 *   verge44    [9.0, -44.0]   the school verge, north of the gate
 *   verge58    [9.0, -58.0]   under the bicycle shelter
 *   bungu      [-2.4, -62.7]  outside 文具・書籍 ひばり堂
 *   bunguYard  [-9.6, -63.0]  its back yard, in from the south
