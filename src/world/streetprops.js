 *
 * Two things worth knowing before placing one:
 *
 *  - The gate is on **+z** and stands ajar, so its leaf swings 0.6 m out of
 *    the footprint on the hinge side.  A collider sized to the walls alone
 *    leaves the leaf inside the walkable lane, and the player's `RADIUS` is
 *    added to every side of it.
 *  - The collection plate goes flat on the **left-hand wall** (looking at the
 *    gate, so local -x), not on the front: the front is a mesh leaf that
 *    swings, and a rigid notice bolted to it swings away with it.  The caller
 *    turns the whole enclosure with `ry` to put the plate on the approach.
 *    The plate is 0.42 x 0.30, i.e. 7:5, so `o.plateMap` wants drawing to
 *    that -- a map at the wrong aspect renders as an unreadable smear, not as
