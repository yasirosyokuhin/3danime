/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * 裏山 -- the low hills.
 *
 * The town has been flat since the relief was switched off, and this is what
 * replaces it: a genuinely large area of low, broad, gently rolling hill land
 * behind the school, wrapping round the east side of the estate and running
 * north up the west side to cross the railway, which goes through it in a
 * tunnel.  Nothing in it is above 17 m.  It is the first thing in this world
 * that is landscape rather than town, and the first walkable ground that is not
 * a plane.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * WHY IT IS NOT `reliefAt` TURNED BACK ON
 *
 * `planet.js` already had low hills, behind one constant, and the reason they
 * are off is written out at length there: the world has **two** ground surfaces
 * 65 mm apart -- the graded terrain grid in `street.js` and the planet sphere --
 * and the relief displaced only the sphere.  Anywhere it passed 65 mm the sphere
 * came up through the grid, and through the road, the lanes, the pads, the kerbs
 * and the tyres of anything parked on them: 7 346 m² of the walkable bounds and
 * 21 colliders standing on ground the sphere had risen through.
 *
 * Displacing both surfaces does not fix it either, because the road, the lanes
 * and every pad in the world are authored against `groundY(z)` alone -- a
 * function of latitude only -- so a hill under any of them cuts through the
 * paving no matter which surfaces carry it.
 *
 * So the hills here are **a third surface, on top of both**, and the two
 * existing ones are not touched at all:
 *
 *   - `hillAt(x, z)` is an analytic height added alongside `reliefAt` by
 *     `world.heightAt` and `ctx.groundAt`, so the player walks it and every
 *     builder seats props on it for free.  It is deliberately **not** folded
 *     into `reliefAt` itself, because `buildPlanet` samples that function too --
 *     and the sphere must stay flat.  Its facets are 5.4 m against this
 *     lattice's 6.0 m, so a sphere carrying the same field would chord across
 *     the creases and poke up to 0.14 m through the hill mesh in a pattern
 *     nobody could diagnose.  Flat, it is 65-80 mm under everything, always.
 *   - the drawn hill is its own mesh at `groundY(z) + field - TERRAIN_DROP`,
 *     i.e. in exactly the same relationship to the reference plane as the flat
 *     terrain grid is.  Where the field is positive it is above the grid and
 *     hides it; where the field is negative it is *below* the grid and the grid
 *     is the ground.  The two surfaces meet along the contour `field = 0`, which
 *     is a line and not an area, so there is nothing to z-fight over.
 *   - and the field is **exactly zero** over every square metre of built ground,
 *     guaranteed by the keep-out list below and verified numerically rather than
 *     by eye (see `hillSafety`).
 *
 * The cost of doing it this way is that the hills are only *near* the town, not
 * under it, which is exactly what was wanted anyway.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * WHY IT IS A LATTICE
 *
 * The art direction is low-poly-but-accurate, and a smooth analytic hill sampled
 * on the 2 m terrain grid is neither: it comes out as a soft blob with tonal
 * contours and almost nothing for the ink pass to find.  So the field is
 * **piecewise linear over a 6 m triangular lattice** -- `nodeAt(i, j)` is the
 * only place a height is ever computed, and both the mesh and `hillAt` read it
 * through the same two-triangle interpolation.  That buys three things at once:
 *
 *   - the drawn surface is genuinely faceted, non-indexed and flat-shaded, so
 *     every facet edge is a crease the depth-difference ink pass draws;
 *   - the walkable surface and the drawn surface are the same surface, to the
 *     bit, with no clearance fudge anywhere;
 *   - and the whole thing is one cheap pure function, so a builder can ask what
 *     height the ground is at a point before any of it has been built.
 *
 * `subdivideLongEdges` bisects the 6 m facets on the way to the sphere, and that
 * does not soften them: the midpoint of an edge of a planar triangle is on the
 * plane, so the facet survives the bake as a facet.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * WHAT SETS THE SLOPES
 *
 * Every summit is a quartic bump `h·(1 - d²)²` over an ellipse, combined with a
 * screen blend rather than a sum so two overlapping summits read as one ridge
 * without adding to twice the height.  The ground only rises where the blended
 * shape beats `PED`, a 2.6 m pedestal -- and that, not the keep-out mask, is
 * what puts the toe of every slope where it is.  It matters which way round:
 *
 *   a mask ramp is 12 m wide, so if the mask were doing the work a 16 m hill
 *   would climb out of the ground at 55°.  A quartic bump crosses the pedestal
 *   at d = 0.773 with a gradient of 1.25·h/r, so a 16 m summit on a 56 m radius
 *   comes out of the ground at 20° and reaches its top 43 m later.  That is the
 *   difference between a hill and a wall, and it is why the radii here are all
 *   between 26 and 86 m for heights between 8.5 and 17 m.
 *
 * The keep-out mask is a **safety net**: it guarantees `hillAt` is 0 over built
 * ground, and if it ever has to bite it will make a cliff -- which is a much
 * better failure outside the town than a hillside through the school's paving.
 *
 * But it *does* bite, unavoidably, and that is the second half of the story.
 * The school's back wall is at z = -86 and the hill-foot road behind it wants
 * the ground flat to z = -95, so the mask is zero there whatever the summits
 * say.  A mask ramp is 13 m wide; multiply a 16 m bump by a ramp that short and
 * the ground climbs out of the flat at 40-45° -- measured, on the first pass:
 * 0.78 at x = 30 between z = -104 and -110.  Widening the ramp does not fix it
 * either.  Going from 0 at z = -96 to 16 m at z = -140 averages 20° whatever
 * shape you choose, and the local maximum is always some multiple of that.
 *
 * So there is a **slope limiter**, and it is the thing that actually makes the
 * word "gentle" true rather than hoped for.  After the lattice is built, a
 * relaxation pass repeatedly *lowers* any node that stands more than
 * `maxSlope · CELL` above a neighbour, until nothing does.  It only ever lowers,
 * which is what keeps every guarantee above intact -- the keep-out stays zero,
 * the buried apron stays buried -- and it converges to the highest surface under
 * the designed one whose gradient is everywhere inside the limit.  Twelve metres
 * of the massif's toe are shaped by it and the summits are untouched, because a
 * 16.5 m summit 45 m behind a pinned toe is already inside a 1-in-2.
 *
 * And there is a trap in it, which cost a pass: **a limiter pinned along a
 * straight line produces a perfectly straight, perfectly uniform ramp.**  The
 * first version had one keep-out rectangle whose south edge ran the whole width
 * of the town, and the twenty-four metres behind the school came out as an
 * exactly constant 1-in-2 plane -- the same height at x = 0, 30 and 60, to the
 * centimetre.  It read as an embankment, and worse, there was no oblique route up
 * it: the field varied only with latitude, so every possible path was either
 * straight up the fall line or dead level, and the main trail measured 0.52.  The
 * fix is in `KEEP`: the town's rectangle stops at z = -80 and only the school and
 * its two roads reach -96, so the pinned line has a twenty-metre step in it and
 * the toe crosses the map on a diagonal.  That diagonal is what the main trail
 * traverses, and it is why the climb is 1 in 6 instead of 1 in 2.
 *
 * The limit is **not uniform**, and the exception is the interesting part: it is
 * 1.9 inside the two ring corridors and 0.52 everywhere else.  A railway
 * cutting *is* steep -- that is what a cutting is -- and the tunnel spur has to
 * rise 17 m in the 12 m between the lineside fence and its own crest or the
 * mountain the railway goes through is a hummock.  The channel's valley sides
 * are the same argument.  Both are engineered faces that `tunnel.js` and
 * `canal.js` retain and face; a wooded hillside behind a school is not, and gets
 * the 27° limit.
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ */

/**
 * Lattice pitch.  Also the facet size, so it is an art decision as much as a
 * sampling one -- and it is **cheaper** than the 6 m it started at, for the same
 * reason `street.js`'s terrain grid is cheaper at 2 m rows than at 2.5 m: the
 * bake's `subdivideLongEdges` splits anything over 4 m, and a 6 m cell has an
 * 8.49 m diagonal that takes three passes to get under the limit, so 2 200
 * triangles arrived as 18 000.  A 3 m cell's diagonal is 4.24 m and splits once,
 * so 8 900 arrive as about 13 000 -- four times the facets on screen for less
 * geometry than the coarse version cost.
 *
 * And it has to be about this fine, which was the second thing the first render
 * showed: standing *on* a hillside you are two or three metres from the ground,
 * so at 6 m a single facet was most of the frame and the slope read as a wall
 * of flat card.  At 3 m the near ground is six or seven facets across, which is
 * the density the roofs and walls in the town are drawn at.
 *
 * 3.0 also divides every tunnel portal plane (-132, -96, 108, 138) and every
 * notch edge (-15, 21, 24) exactly, which is what lets each cap meet the field
 * with no seam.
 */
export const CELL = 1.5;

/* **1.5, halved from 3.0, and the reason is a close-up rather than a number.**
 *
 * Everything above is still true and 3.0 was a good decision at the time: it was
 * *cheaper* than the 6.0 it replaced (a 6 m cell's 8.49 m diagonal takes three
 * passes of `subdivideLongEdges` to get under the limit, so 2 200 triangles
 * arrived as 18 000) and the note argued it matched the density the town's roofs
 * and walls are drawn at.
 *
 * What it does not survive is standing on the hill.  From the toe of the massif a
 * single 3 m facet is a third of the frame, and because the surface is very nearly
 * planar over tens of metres — measured, the normal turns 7.0° per facet pair at
 * the median — adjacent facets land in the same cel band and read as *one* flat
 * card ten metres across with an ink line down it.  Coarse is exactly the word.
 *
 * 1.5 is the only other value that works, and that is arithmetic rather than
 * taste: every notch edge and portal plane has to stay on a lattice line or the
 * tunnel caps stop meeting the field, and −132, −96, 108, 138, −15, 21 and 24 are
 * all multiples of 1.5 and **−15 is not a multiple of 2.0**.  It also divides 3.0,
 * so every line that was on the old lattice is still on this one.
 *
 * It costs about four times the nodes (45 000 against 11 400) and about three
 * times the drawn triangles — but the diagonal is 2.12 m now, under the bake's
 * split threshold, so nothing is subdivided on the way to the sphere and the
 * post-bake count only rises from 22 k to about 60 k, in the same six draw calls.
 *
 * **And it is worthless on its own.**  Halving the cell halves the normal turn per
 * facet, so without a roughness octave at the new scale the result is smaller flat
 * cards rather than fewer of them.  See `ULTRA`. */

 *     lets it rise from there -- which is a railway cutting, and is what the
 *     tunnel's approach is made of.
 *   - the drainage channel at z = -24, whose made ground reaches ±6 m and whose
 *     railings run the whole way round at ±2.4.  A tighter corridor, 6.5 to 14,
 *     because the channel only ever needed to be in a valley floor and the band
 *     between it and the railway is 24 m wide in total.
 *
 * The two corridors combine with `min` rather than by multiplying: in that 24 m

 * between the channel and the track to nothing instead of leaving the low

 *    **south**, looking at a hillside.
 *  - **東山トンネル**, through the east shoulder, is a **col**.  There is hill on

/* --------------------------- the second octave ---------------------------
 * **`MICRO` fixed the wrong problem, and the measurement is what says so.**
 *
 * The note above is right that a sum of wide ellipses under a slope limiter has
 * no shading on it, and 170 scattered bumps did give the massif *shape*.  What it
 * did not give it is *surface*: measured over 4 300 facet pairs, the normal turned
 * only **3.16° per 3 m facet at the median** (p25 1.9, p75 5.1, p90 8.0).  A three
 * band cel ramp needs of the order of 15-25° to step a band, so the ramp crossed a
 * boundary about once every twenty metres and the hillside rendered as one flat
 * area of green with a handful of straight ink creases across it -- which is what
 * a heightfield looks like when its roughness is at the wrong *wavelength*.
 *
 * `MICRO`'s radii are 5-29 m.  A bump of amplitude `h` and radius `r` with the
 * profile `h(1-d²)²` has a maximum gradient of `1.54 h / r` reached at
 * `d = 0.577`, so its slope builds over more than half its radius: at r = 14 that
 * is 11° of normal change spread across seven facets.  Per facet it is nothing.
 *
 * So this is the same construction three times smaller, and the arithmetic is the
 * whole design: r ≈ 4.5 and h ≈ 0.42 gives 1.54 × 0.42 / 4.5 = 0.144 of gradient
 * built over 2.6 m, i.e. of the order of 0.17 of slope change across one 3 m
 * facet -- about 10°, per facet, which is what the cel ramp needs.  2 400 of them
 * covers the 97 600 m² window about 1.6 times over, so almost every facet is
 * inside one or two.
 *
 * **Hollows are 42 % rather than 34 %.**  At this scale the eye reads convexity as
 * lumps and concavity as ground, and a hillside wants slightly more of the second.

/* ------------------------------- the cover -------------------------------
 * **The third term in the tone, and the one the near belt needed.**
 *
 * `faceTone` keys off slope, height and aspect, and the palette note explains why
 * it has to: the cel ramp's band boundaries are at `dotNL = ±1/3`, two thirds of
 * the hill sits in the top band, and crossing into the next one takes about 35° of
 * normal change — a metre and a half of relief per 3 m cell.  Direct light will
 * not draw this hill's form, so the material has to.
 *
 * What that misses is measurable.  Over the 28 m belt behind the school — the one
 * piece of hillside the town, the hill-foot road and the school ground all look
 * *at* — the numbers are:
 *
 *     lit    p10 0.42   p50 0.73   p90 0.89
 *     key    p10 0.40   p50 0.71   p90 0.94      threshold 0.46 ± 0.15
 *     => 88 % of it lands in `hillSun` and **0 %** in the deep tone
 *
 * Which is correct behaviour and a bad picture: it is one slope with one aspect,
 * so an aspect term is constant over it, and the height term only spans 8 m there
 * and contributes 0.16.  Forty metres of hillside came out as a single sheet of
 * pale green with a few straight ink creases across it, and no amount of roughness
 * fixes that, because the roughness turns the normal 7° at the median and the ramp
 * needs 35.
 *
 * So this is a **cover field**: how dry and thin the ground is, at the scale a
 * patch of cover actually is.  Same construction as `MICRO` and `FINE` a scale up
 * — scattered ellipses, 9 to 26 m, half of them negative — and it is deliberately
 * *not* derived from the terrain at all.  A hillside's vegetation is not a
 * function of its shape; it is where the last fire was, where the deer browse, what
 * was cleared forty years ago and never came back.  Anything derived from slope or
 * height would be another term that is constant over a uniform slope, which is the
 * problem rather than the fix.
 *
 * Read at the **cell centre**, like `tj` and for the same reason: a value handed to
 * a cell's two triangles differently is confetti, and this one drives the largest

 *     line is 0.0 for eighteen metres and then 3.1 m in the next twelve -- a

 *     cuts and fills to **that** instead of sampling the field.  Which is simply
 *     what a road is: a designed longitudinal section, cut into the high ground
 *     and filled over the low.
 *
 * Fill is still refused inside a keep-out, exactly as it is for the trails, and
 * that is why `湖畔道路` is specified at 0.0 for its whole run up the school's
 * east side: it is one metre outside `KEEP[0]`, where `hillSafety`'s margin

/**
 * **The bench, and it is the mechanism the trails were missing.**
 *
 * `hillPath` lays a ribbon on whatever the field does, so a path across a steep
 * face inherits the *cross*-slope of that face — it is a strip of gravel painted
 * on a 1-in-2 bank, not a path.  Nobody noticed while the walker was the only
 * thing tested, because the walker has no slope limit and simply follows the
 * height query wherever it goes.
 *
 * The flood fill does not walk like that.  It steps 0.35 m along an axis and
 * refuses a rise over 0.38, and on ground held at the rail corridor's own 1.9
 * allowance **every** such step is a rise of 0.63 to 0.78 — measured across the
 * whole band z 11…23 behind ひばり山's east portal, in both directions and on two
 * different candidate routes.  So no route across that bank was ever climbable by
 * anything but the walker; the old 3 m lattice interpolated the face coarsely
 * enough to leave one line that squeaked under the limit, and halving the cell
 * resolved it honestly and took the overlook away.
 *
 * A mountain path on a 1-in-2 slope is a **cut bench** — that is what 切土 is —
 * and once the cross-slope is gone the only gradient left is the path's own
 * longitudinal one, which is designed and measured.  An axial step then climbs
 * `grade · 0.35 · cos θ` where θ is the angle between the axis and the path, so a
 * diagonal leg never presents its full gradient to the fill at all.
 *
 * **It only ever lowers.**  Same discipline as the slope limiter, and for the same
 * reason: cut is safe everywhere, fill is not.  Raising the field near a trail
 * could push it up through something built (the 山裾の道 runs 7 m off the
 * hill-foot road) and would invalidate every guarantee `hillSafety` checks.  A
 * bench cut into a slope with the downhill side left alone is also simply what one
 * looks like.
 *
 * The profile is sampled from the trail's own vertices **before any of this runs**,
 * so it is the natural ground at the points the route was designed against — not
 * a moving target that would drift as the cut proceeds.
 *
 * **Except where a route says otherwise.**  `ROUTES` may give a vertex a third
 * number, and then that is the profile: a road is a designed section, not a
 * follower of the land.  `BENCH_FLAT`/`BENCH_FADE` above are the defaults a
 * 1.35 m footpath gets; every entry in `ROUTES` carries its own.

 * The plantation blocks, and the reason they are **blocks**.
 *
 * `trees.js`'s `buildCedar` gives the range a second silhouette; this decides
 * where it goes, and scattering it would throw away most of what it is for.  A
 * Japanese hillside is not a mixture: it is broadleaf with rectangles of 杉
 * planted into it, on compartment lines that cut straight across the contours,
 * and the **hard edge between the two is as recognisable as either species**.  A
 * cedar every fifth tree reads as a range with some dark trees on it; forty
 * cedars in a block with a straight side reads as a hillside somebody owns.
 *
 * So a stand is a rotated rectangle, the trees inside it are on a **grid** at
 * `pitch` with less jitter than the rectangle is wide, and the broadleaf sampler
 * refuses every candidate inside one.  Both readers go through `standAt`, so the
 * boundary cannot drift between the thing that plants the cedar and the thing
 * that keeps the oak out of it.
 *
 * Three rules the placements follow:
 *
 *   - **never in zone 0.**  The 26 m belt behind the school is deliberately
 *     thin -- it is the part you look *at*, from the hill-foot road and from the
 *     school, and the whole range is behind it.  A block of 11 m cedar there is a
 *     wall 20 m from the back fence.
 *   - **on ground a frame actually looks at.**  The hills cannot be seen from the
 *     town at this radius (measured: the highest visible point is 12.9 m *below*
 *     the sight line from the crossing), so every one of these is placed against
 *     a viewpoint that exists -- the crest walk, the 林間広場, the hill-foot
 *     road's east end, and the two tunnel mouths, which are the only frames in
 *     the world where a hillside fills half the picture.
 *   - **let them cross a notch.**  D and E overlap a tunnel cap, and `tunnel.js`
 *     asks `standAt` for its own planting, so a block runs over the mountain the
 *     railway goes through instead of stopping at an invisible rectangle.  That
 *     continuity is the whole reason this is one exported function and not a
 *     list in each module.
