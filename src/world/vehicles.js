/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * 機動車 -- the motor vehicles.
 *
 * One generator, nine bodies, the way `makeShop` is one generator and nine
 * tenants.  Everything parked anywhere in this world comes out of
 * `makeVehicle`, and a kind is a *table row* rather than a function, because
 * the class of bug this file exists to avoid is the one `NEXT.md` records
 * against the bicycle: two hand-placed copies of the same assembly, neither of
 * which joined up.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * THE CONVENTION
 *
 * Authored **along +x with the nose at +x**, origin at ground level in the
 * centre of the footprint.  That is the vehicle convention already in the
 * world -- `makeKeiTruck`, `makeBicycle` and `makeScooter` are all built that
 * way -- so one `ry` noses everything the same direction, and a car parked in
 * a rack of bicycles points where they do.
 *
 * `ry` is therefore the direction the nose faces:
 *   0      nose +x        PI/2   nose -z
 *   PI     nose -x       -PI/2   nose +z
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * HOW A BODY IS DESCRIBED
 *
 * A vehicle in this style is read from four things and nothing else: the
 * proportion of glasshouse to body, the rake of the two screens, where the
 * wheels sit under the arches, and the mirrors.  So that is all the table
 * carries.
 *
 *   L, W, R          overall length, overall width, wheel radius
 *   axle [f, r]      the two axle centres in x -- the wheels are drawn *there*
 *   sill, waist      bottom and top of the lower body mass.  `waist` is the
 *                    beltline: the bonnet, the boot lid and the window sill are
 *                    all one height on a car drawn this way, and pretending
 *                    otherwise costs two masses and reads no better.
 *   roof             height to the roof panel
 *   cab [r, f]       where the glasshouse meets the waist, rear and front
 *   rakeF, rakeR     how far the roof edge is set *back* from each of those.
 *                    The screens are then drawn **between two points** rather
 *                    than as a box given a guessed tilt -- the mistake the
 *                    overbridge stringers made in both directions.
 *   side [x0, x1]    the extent of the side glazing.  A delivery van is glazed
 *                    over its cab and panelled behind it, and that one number
 *                    is the whole difference between a van and a minivan.
 *   extra []         additional masses: a box body, a load bed, a raised roof.
 *
 * Everything else -- arches, bumpers, lamps, plates, seams, handles, mirrors,
 * wipers -- is derived from those, so a new kind is a row and not a function.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * COST
 *
 * Seven baked meshes per vehicle (body, deep, dark, brite, glass, and the two
 * lamp colours), plus one for the plates.  No inverted-hull outline unless the
 * caller asks: `outline.js` is for the handful of hero props the README names,
 * the screen-space ink pass already fires on every silhouette in the frame, and
 * fifty extra shells is fifty extra draw calls in a scene that is measurably
 * draw-call bound.  The one hero vehicle in the world is the kei truck at the
 * crossing, and it keeps its shell.
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ */

/* ------------------------------ the palette ------------------------------ *
 * Everyday Japanese suburban colours only: the car park outside a clinic is
 * white, silver, beige and one dark green, and that is not a stylisation --
 * it is what is actually parked there.  Held inside the world's existing

 * deliberately short of anything saturated: no reds beyond a muted wine, no
