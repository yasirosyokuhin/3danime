 * rather than because a range wants variety.  Everything green on ひばり山 came
 * out of `buildGrove`, which has exactly **one** canopy form: a cloud of
 * icosahedral blobs round a short trunk, in three tones.  Vary the scale, the
 * spread and the lean of that as much as you like and every tree in the world is
 * still the same rounded lump, so a hundred and fifty metres of hillside is a
 * field of identical bubbles with a smooth green arc for a skyline.
 *
 * A Japanese 里山 is *read* as Japanese by its 杉林: tall, narrow, dark, conical,
 * clean-trunked, planted in blocks with a hard straight edge against the
 * broadleaf.  Adding it fixes three separate things at once and that is why it
 * is worth a second generator rather than another set of tones:
 *
 *   - **scale.**  A faceted hillside has nothing on it of known size (the same
 *     argument `buildOutcrops` is there for, one order up).  An 11 m tree with a
 *     3.4 m crown standing on a 14 m hill says how big the hill is; a 6 m blob
 *     does not, because a blob could be a bush two metres away.
 *   - **the skyline.**  The ridge lines were a smooth green arc, because the
 *     blob canopy's silhouette is a circle and a row of circles is a scallop.  A
 *     row of narrow cones is a saw, which is what a wooded ridge looks like
 *     against the sky and what the ink pass has been wanting something to draw.
 *   - **vertical.**  Nothing on the range stood up.  The cel ramp cannot shade a
 *     gentle slope here (see the note by `hillGrassSun` in the palette), so the
 *     only way a slope reads as a slope is for something on it to be *plumb* and
 *     for the eye to compare the two.  A cedar is the most plumb thing there is.
 *
 * **The construction is a stack of cones, and it must not be blobs.**  The whole
 * value of the species is that its silhouette differs; drawing it out of the same
 * `IcosahedronGeometry` in darker greens gives a dark bubble, which is worse than
 * nothing because it reads as the grove in shadow.  Seven overlapping 7-sided
 * cones of decreasing radius, each turned a random amount about its own axis, is
 * one instanced draw call per tone and comes out as a narrow ragged wedge.
 *
 * **The trunk carries the base of the tree on its own.**  A plantation is pruned,
 * so the bottom third to two fifths of the stem is bare -- and a stand of bare
 * vertical stems under a dark canopy is the single most recognisable thing about
 * a 杉林 from inside it.  So the crown starts at 0.30-0.42 of the height, not at
 * the ground, and the trunk is a redder wood than the broadleaf's.
 *
 * Two things are deliberate and easy to undo:
 *
 *   - **the lean is almost nothing** (0-0.045 against the grove's 0.02-0.14).
 *     Planted sugi are dead straight, and the straightness is the tell.  It is
 *     also arithmetic: the trunk here is placed by its **base** rather than by its
 *     centre, because at 11 m a lean of 0.06 applied about the centre walks the
 *     foot of the tree a third of a metre away from its own collider.
 *   - **no canopy receives shadow**, blossom or green or needle.  A ramp only
 *     shapes direct light, so a blob the shadow map has zeroed falls back to
 *     ambient -- and at `cedarDeep` (0x2f5540) ambient under a violet tint is
 *     very nearly black.  This is the failure that hung round dark circles in the
 *     sky off the grove canopies for several rounds; see the long note there.
