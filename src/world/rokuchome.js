/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * ひばり台六丁目 -- the bus turnaround and the streets round it.
 *
 * The twenty-second district, and the first one laid out round a *vehicle
 * movement* rather than round a building.  ひばり台ふれあい号 has existed for a
 * round with one stop outside the library and nowhere to turn round; a route
 * that does not end anywhere is a timetable with no reason.  So this block is
 * the end of the line: the last stretch of the route, the circle the bus turns
 * in, and the dozen or so households whose connection to the rest of the town
 * is that circle.
 *
 * It is deliberately **not a terminus**.  A Japanese コミュニティバス折返場 on
 * the edge of an estate is a widened piece of residential road with a stop
 * pole, a shelter, a bay or two and a mirror -- no stands, no interchange, no
 * building.  What makes it read is the ordinariness of everything round it: a
 * 弁当屋, three marked bays, somebody's washing, a hedge on a retaining wall.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * THE LAND, measured rather than remembered -- the 四丁目 lesson.
 *
 * Envelope x 45..80, z 40..70.  A sweep of `world.colliders` over it before a
 * single coordinate was chosen found this and nothing else:
 *
 *   the north lane's east arm   x 40..48.6, z 43.5..46.9 (`northblock.js`),
 *                               continued by 二丁目's north T at x 47.8..52.2,
 *                               z 43.5..46.9, **top 0.513** (`nichome.js`).
 *                               That surface is where this district starts and
 *                               its height is the height everything is paved to.
 *   三丁目's 片流れの平屋       x 42.90..48.70, z 47.80..53.40, and its front
 *                               garden's 板塀 at x 48.86..49.14 / z 46.00..47.90.
 *                               **That 0.28 m fence is the entire reason the
 *                               connector is at x 51.00 and not at 50.00.**
 *   三丁目's 連棟 三戸          x 39.10..45.50, z 55.95..64.85 -- the west
 *                               boundary for six metres of the north lane
 *   a 三丁目 grove tree         x 46.95..48.25, z 57.95..59.25, top 6.32
 *   二丁目's コーポ みなみ      x 51.90..56.50, z 41.80..45.80 -- the south side
 *                               of the main street is *its* back for five metres
 *   二丁目's back-edge grove    (68.9, 41.0) and (63.4, 43.2), and shrubs at
 *                               (60.75, 40.2) and (66.35, 38.9)
 *
 * Everything else in that envelope is empty ground, which is why the district
 * is here: it was the largest unbuilt parcel left beside something finished.
 *
 * **The ground had to be graded, and this is the only district in the world cut
 * into a hill.**  The shoulder rising north-east of 二丁目 read 1.4 m at
 * (60, 56) and 2.2 m at (60, 60) -- straight through where the turnaround is --
 * so `planet.js` gains a pad at (62, 55), rx 17 / rz 11.  Its north edge stops
 * short of the block's on purpose: the ground starts climbing again at z = 66
 * and is 2.4 m up by z = 72.  That bank is not a leftover.  It is what the
 * retaining wall, the hedge above it and the grove line are standing on, and it
 * is the reason the town stops here rather than merely running out.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * WHAT THE ARITHMETIC DECIDED
 *
 * **The turning circle is 12.4 m across and that is a decision, not a
 * rounding.**  `SPEC.minibus` is 6.30 x 2.08, so its outer front corner sweeps
 * a shade over 6 m: a 6.20 m paved radius is one 切り返し, which is what a
 * driver actually does at the end of a suburban route four times a day.  A
 * radius the bus could go round in one sweep is 8 m -- a 16 m circle -- and at
 * that size it stops being a widened road and becomes a bus station, which the
 * brief rules out and which nothing else in this town would survive next to.
 *
 * **The paving is one extruded polygon, not a rectangle plus a disc.**  Two
 * slabs at one height overlapping is z-fighting across the most important
 * fifteen metres in the district; butting them leaves two crescent slivers of
 * grass at the throat.  A `THREE.Shape` -- street rectangle, `absarc` the long
 * way round the circle, back along the north edge -- is one surface with no
 * seam, and it gives the ink pass the only genuinely curved silhouette in a
 * world otherwise made of boxes.
 *
 * **The open stair is what placed every block here.**  `makeWalkup` builds it
 * 1.6 m beyond the local -x end, *outside* the mass and therefore outside
 * `plotCollide`'s box, and it was the binding constraint twice: コーポ ひがし's
 * lands at x 60.80..62.40 and 第二 さくら荘's at 68.70..70.30, which is what
 * fixes the terrace's west gable at 70.50 and not at 69.  Both are written out
 * below and both carry their own collider, because the plot box does not.
 *
 * **Three bays, not five.**  The brief asked for three to five; the land
 * offered 7.4 m of frontage between the north lane and the walk-up's stair.
 * Three at 2.4 m fills it exactly, and `traffic.js`'s own rule is that a bay
 * left empty beside a full one does more work than a second car in it.
 *
 * **There is no south lane.**  One was drafted and cut: it would have run
 * between the two shops and the circle, and the pocket it needed is the only
 * ground the corner node could stand on.  The one detached house opens straight
 * onto the circle's south rim instead, which is a better story than a stub --
 * the house at the end of the line.
