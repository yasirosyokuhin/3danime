/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * ひばり台一丁目 -- the old quarter along the railway, west of the crossing.
 *
 * Everything else in this world is a district you arrive at.  This one is a
 * *street*, and it is the only place in the project where the picture is made
 * out of a corridor rather than out of objects standing in the open:
 *
 *   the railway masking wall   2.2 m of plain concrete, z -4.98, all the way
 *   線路裏の道                 2.4 m of worn asphalt, z -6.9
 *   the frontages              the five old houses and three new ones, z -8.4
 *
 * That is a 4.4 m slot with a wall down one side and doors down the other, and
 * the whole job here is to make it read as a lane somebody lives on: ivy over
 * the wall, wires overhead, a gutter down one side, a 長屋 whose eave hangs out
 * over the carriageway, and four passages cutting south out of it to the
 * 用水路.  Nothing in this world looks like that, and the width is the reason:
 * a 2.4 m lane is one person and one small van, so the player is never more
 * than two metres from anything and the detail level is set by that.
 *
 * Three things about it are load-bearing and easy to undo by accident.
 *
 * **It is visible from the crossing**, which is the opening frame of the whole
 * project, forty metres east.  So the far half (x < -50) is deliberately
 * building mass, roofs, fences and poles and nothing finer -- all the clutter
 * is east of x = -50 where the player actually walks.
 *
 * **The wall stops at x = -30.**  `railway.js` runs its masking wall from
 * x = -118 to -30 and finishes it in a pier, so the lane is a closed slot for
 * its western forty-six metres and opens to the lineside fence for its eastern
 * seventeen.  That change of section halfway along is free and it is the best
 * thing about the street: walking east the wall runs out, the railway appears
 * over a 1.2 m fence, and the crossing is at the end of it.
 *
 * **The long view west is protected.**  Standing at the east mouth the lane
 * runs 63 m dead straight, and what closes it is the walk-up's stair tower with
 * a grove tree behind it.  Everything tall is on the verge (the pole line) or
 * against the frontages (the 長屋's eave posts); nothing stands in the middle.
 * If something has to go in the lane, it goes on the verge.
 *
 * The fourth passage is a lie the block is careful not to tell.  There are four
 * gaps between the five old houses and only three of them are wide enough to
 * walk: x -32.7..-31.4 is 1.3 m, which after the player's own 0.34 m radius on
 * both sides is 0.62 m of clear ground.  It is closed at the lane with a 板塀
 * and a shut gate and filled with a 物置, a stack of crates and a drying pole,
 * because a dead end that looks like a dead end is honest and one that looks
 * like a way through is the single most reported kind of bug in this project.
 *
 * FLOODFILL -- every one of these must be reachable on foot from the spawn:
 *   laneEast      [-13.2, -6.9]    the arrival, where the spur meets the lane

 *
 *  - the eave and its posts must clear the carriageway.  The eave tip lands at
 *    z = -8.38 and the posts at -8.52, so the lane's south edge at -8.10 is
 *    clear by a quarter of a metre.  Half a metre further north and there would
 *    be a 0.16 m timber post standing in a 2.4 m lane every 2.7 m.
 *  - only the volume is collided, never the eave, so the 0.53 m of ground under
 *    the overhang stays walkable.  That strip is the whole point of the type.
