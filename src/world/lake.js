/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * ひばり湖 -- the water.
 *
 * `lakeform.js` says where the lake is and `hills.js` builds the ground it sits
 * in.  This is the surface, the things standing in the shallows, and the four
 * animated layers that stop it being a painted floor.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * THE SURFACE IS FIVE FLAT LAYERS AND A CONTOUR, NOT A SHADER
 *
 * The 用水路 gets away with one blue rectangle because it is 5 m wide, always in
 * the shade of its own revetment, and read from directly above.  None of that is
 * true here: this is ten thousand square metres read from a viewpoint twelve
 * metres up, against a pale sky, with a hundred metres of it in frame.  One flat
 * blue plane at that size is a hole in the picture -- and worse, the canal's tone
 * is *darker* than the sky it is meant to be reflecting.
 *
 * So the water is a stack, and every layer is generated from the **depth field**
 * rather than drawn:
 *
 *   `lakeWater`     the body, over the whole wetted area
 *   `lakeShallow`   0.06 to 0.85 m deep -- green, because that is silt seen
 *                   through water rather than water
 *   `lakeDeep`      over 1.75 m -- blue-violet, and it is the *shape* of this
 *                   band that says the basin has a middle
 *   `lakeSky`       hard-edged pale panels, the same stylisation the canal uses
 *   echoes          block reflections of the far rim and of the blossom on the
 *                   near bank, laid *toward* the viewer from the shore they
 *                   belong to, because that is which way a reflection points
 *
 * All of them come out of one function: **marching squares on a scalar field**.
 * `contourFill` meshes the region where `f > 0` over a grid, interpolating the
 * crossing on each cell edge, so a band is expressed as
 * `min(depth - 0.06, 0.85 - depth)` and the shoreline is
 * `min(depth, distanceInsideTheShoreline)`.  The alternative -- a rectangle
 * masked per cell -- gives a stair-stepped waterline, and on a lake the
 * waterline is the one line the eye actually reads.
 *
 * **Why the shoreline term is needed at all**: `depth` is `LEVEL - field`, and
 * `field` is -1.3 over the whole flat world, so "depth > 0" is true from here to
 * the poles.  Without the polygon the lake is the planet.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * WHY THE ANIMATION IS RIGID GROUPS
 *
 * `canal.js` slides its train streak by writing `mesh.position.x` on a baked
 * mesh, which works there for a reason that does not generalise: the channel is
 * at x ≈ 0, where the flat frame and the world frame are within a couple of
 * centimetres of each other.  This lake is at x = 190, a fifth of the way round
 * the planet, where the local +x is nothing like the world +x -- so a baked mesh
 * translated along world X moves sideways *and downward through the surface*.
 *
 * Every moving thing here is therefore a `planetRigid` group with an inner group
 * under it, exactly as `CLAUDE.md` prescribes: the bake re-seats the outer one on
 * the sphere and leaves the inner one at the identity, and the animation drives
 * the inner one.  It costs one draw call per moving layer, and there are nine.

 *   - **breaks.**  Each echo is three or four separate slabs with gaps, not one
 *     long one, because the surface is never still enough to carry an unbroken
 *     image and a continuous streak reads as ice.
 *
 * The far rim gets `lakeHillEcho`, a desaturated blue-green that is the rim's own

 * railing everywhere (which is what the 用水路 does, and is wrong for a natural

 *
 * So: a barrier, but placed and justified so that it is never the thing you
 * notice.  It runs 0.6 m *inside* the waterline, so with the player's own 0.34 m
 * radius you can stand a quarter of a metre from the edge -- close enough to look
 * straight down into the shallows.  It is broken at all four places there is
