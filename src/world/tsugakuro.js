/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * ひばり台五丁目 -- the houses behind the 通学路.
 *
 * The school route has had two shops on it since the school went in and nothing
 * else: everything west of the carriageway was bare graded ground running out
 * over the horizon, which is exactly the emptiness `approach.js` says the
 * convenience store was put there to fix.  Two buildings cannot fix thirty
 * metres of it, and this is the block that does.
 *
 * The whole idea is that it is the *school's* neighbourhood and reads as one
 * without a single person in it: a staff block, three family houses with
 * gardens deep enough to leave things in, a drop-off bay at the mouth of the
 * link, chalk on a garage apron, a ball box, a kid's bicycle on its side, a
 * notice board with the term's dates on it -- and a 抜け道 between the
 * convenience store and the bakery that comes out on the crossing at the gate,
 * which is the route every child in this town would actually take.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * THE LAND, measured.  The parcel is x -32..-2, z -64..-30, and it is dead
 * flat: `streetHeight + reliefAt` is 1.05 over the whole of it (the school's
 * own graded pad covers x 4..60 and this block's pad, added with the six, runs
 * x -28..2 / z -62..-34).  What is already in it:
 *
 *   the 通学路              carriageway x -0.15..6.15 with its west footway to
 *                           x -1.70, its green belt and its guardrail, running
 *                           to a dead end at z = -65 (`approach.js`, `street.js`)
 *   the canal's south bank  a kerb at z -30.20..-29.84, top 1.27.  The lane's
 *                           north end arrives on the service path behind it.
 *   house at (-15.2,-34.6)  x -19.00..-11.40, z -38.20..-31.00
 *   house at (-5.4,-33.5)   x -9.50..-1.30, z -37.30..-29.70
 *   ひばりマート            x -15.25..-8.00, z -52.55..-43.45, facing 'x+'
 *   パン工房こむぎ          x -11.45..-4.95, z -60.55..-55.05, facing 'x+'
 *   grove trees             (-18,-41), (-19.4,-55), (-15,-62), (-22.6,-33.8)
 *   the pole line           x -2.5 at z -43 and -60.5, x 7.4 at z -37.5 / -53.5
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * WHAT THE ARITHMETIC DECIDED
 *
 * **The lane is at x = -21.8 and not -19.** -19 is where it wants to be -- one
 * plot back from the road -- and it is where the house at (-15.2,-34.6) has its
 * west wall.  -21.8 with a 3.2 m carriageway puts the east kerb at -20.2, which
 * clears that house by 1.2 m and the grove tree at (-19.4,-55) by 1.34.  It
 * does *not* clear the tree at (-22.6,-33.8), whose collider is x -23.33..-21.87
 * -- squarely in the carriageway -- so that one moves west, and it is recorded
 * with the other nudges to existing content.  It has been moved once before, out
 * of the roof of the house on the canal's north bank.
 *
 * **The 抜け道 is 2.0 m because that is all there is.**  ひばりマート's south
 * wall is at z -52.55 and こむぎ's north wall at -55.05: 2.5 m, which after the
 * player's 0.34 m radius on each side is 1.82 m of walkable ground.  It is the
 * tightest deliberate route in the block and it is the best thing in it -- you
 * come out of it onto the painted crossing at the school gate.
 *
 * **The staff block's stair decided its z.**  `makeWalkup` builds its open stair
 * 1.6 m beyond the local -x end, and for `face: 'x+'` local -x is world +z, so
 * the stair stands at the block's *north* end.  At z = -35.0 it would have come
 * down on the canal's bank kerb; -36.6 puts it clear with the forecourt still
 * addressing the lane.
 *
 * FLOODFILL -- every one of these must be reachable on foot from the spawn:
 *   laneN      [-21.8, -31.4]  the north end, on the canal's south service path
 *   laneMid    [-21.8, -45.0]  outside the 二階半, opposite the shops' backs
 *   laneS      [-21.8, -62.0]  the south end and its turning stub
 *   staffFront [-24.0, -36.6]  グリーンハイツ's gallery and its mailbox bank
 *   atticGate  [-24.6, -45.6]  the 二階半's gate on the lane
 *   houseGate  [-24.9, -53.4]  the detached house's gate
 *   terraceA   [-24.8, -59.6]  the 連棟's west front garden
 *   linkA      [-12.0, -41.4]  the cross link, between the two old houses
 *   dropOff    [-3.2, -39.2]   the 送迎 bay at the link's mouth on the road.
 *                              Was [-5.2, -39.0], the middle of the bay; a
 *                              minivan is parked across it now (`traffic.js`),
 *                              so the probe moved to the clear east end of it.
 *   nukemichi  [-13.0, -53.8]  the 抜け道 between the shops
 *   nukeEast   [-3.4, -53.8]   where it comes out on the school route
 *   service    [-17.8, -47.0]  ひばりマート's back yard, off the lane
