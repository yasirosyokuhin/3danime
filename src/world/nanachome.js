/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * ひばり台七丁目 -- スーパー さかえ and its roof car park.
 *
 * The twenty-third district, and the first one built round a *building* that
 * is bigger than a house.  Everything in this world so far has been at the
 * scale of a shop, a hall or a school block; a 地域スーパー is the one thing a
 * Japanese suburb has that is genuinely large and genuinely ordinary, and the
 * whole design problem is to make 350 m² of shed read as somewhere people go
 * on the way home rather than as a box dropped on a field.
 *
 * Three things do that work, and none of them is the building:
 *
 *  - **the 前場** -- the apron between the doors and the road, which is where a
 *    Japanese supermarket actually lives: the trolley bay, the basket stack, the
 *    drinks cases, the recycling cage, the A-board, the umbrella stand and the
 *    machines.  It is dressed harder than any frontage in the world except the
 *    vending corner, and for the same reason: you stand two metres from all of
 *    it.
 *  - **the 屋上駐車場** -- the roof deck, fourteen bays, reached by a 34.5 m
 *    ramp that wraps the store's east and south flanks.  It is the second
 *    vertical viewpoint in the world after the overbridge, and the only one you
 *    can drive to.
 *  - **the 荷捌き場** -- the delivery yard behind the west gable, screened by a
 *    wall so you find it rather than are shown it.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * THE LAND, measured rather than remembered -- the 四丁目 lesson.
 *
 * Envelope x -58..-6, z 58..102, swept against `world.colliders` before a
 * single coordinate was chosen.  What is in it:
 *
 *   湯の坂's terrace          x -46.80..-18.60, z 40.60..59.60, deck at **3.20**,
 *                             i.e. 2.75 m above this parcel.  Its north
 *                             retaining wall runs x -46.8..-27.0 and
 *                             -19.6..-18.6, top 3.75.
 *   **the 7.4 m gap in it**   x -27.0..-19.6 has *no wall and no railing*, and a
 *                             2.75 m drop.  `onsen.js` left the opening and
 *                             never built anything in it -- the same class of
 *                             finding as 川端の道's unguarded water.  This
 *                             district closes it: fourteen steps in the middle
 *                             of the gap and a railing either side, which is
 *                             also the store's own way up to 湯の坂.
 *   the onsen's east screen   grove at (-15.2, 58.8) and (-12.8, 62.2) -- the
 *                             two northernmost of `onsen.js`'s four screen
 *                             trees, and **neither moves**: they are 桜守裏町's
 *                             west side.  The 2.4 m footpath east threads
 *                             between them at z = 64.2, clearing the northern
 *                             one by 0.17 m.
 *   桜守裏町                  shrub (-16.6, 65.4), cherry (-16.4, 66.8), the
 *                             木造平屋 at x -15.18..-10.82 / z 66.62..69.78, a
 *                             grove at (-16.8, 70.6), the 長屋 at x -10.8..-0.4
 *                             / z 66.30..70.90 with its 0.92 m eave to z 71.82,
 *                             and its arm (a lane, no collider) at z 63.65..65.95
 *                             from x -11.45 east.
 *   桜守裏町's back planting  grove at (-8.0, 73.4) and (-2.0, 72.8)
 *   四丁目's pocket park      x 1.4..9.8, z 71.9..79.7, railed all round with one
 *                             3.2 m entrance at x 4.4..7.6
 *   四丁目's lane             x 4.3..7.7, running north to z = 72.0
 *
 * **Everything else in that envelope is empty field, dead flat at 0.45.**  Six
 * grove trees stood in the middle of it (`onsen.js`'s north screen, at
 * (-44.0, 62.4) (-39.4, 64.4) (-34.8, 66.4) (-30.2, 62.4) (-25.6, 64.4) and
 * (-21.0, 66.4)) and they are gone -- the brief asked for the ground to be
 * cleared, and the store now does the job they were doing, which was to give
 * 湯の坂's back something to stand against.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * WHAT THE ARITHMETIC DECIDED
 *
 * **The deck is at 6.20 and the ramp is 34.5 m long, and the second number is
 * what fixed the first.**  A self-parking ramp is limited to 1/6, so the run is
 * six times the rise and there is nowhere to put a straight one: the parcel is
 * 30 m across and a 6.2 m deck wants 35.  Wrapping two adjacent flanks of the
 * store is the only shape that fits -- 16.4 m down the east flank, a landing at
 * the south-east corner, 18.1 m west along the south flank, and the deck
 * entered over its south parapet.  That is why the store is 21.6 x 16.4 and not
 * some rounder number: **the building is the length of its own ramp.**
 *
 * **The corner landing is 5.6 x 4.6 and a saloon does not take it in one.**
 * Same argument as 六丁目's turning circle: a landing a car sweeps in one go is
 * 8 m square, and at that size the ramp stops being a ramp up the side of a
 * shop.  A 軽 makes it; anything longer does one 切り返し, which is exactly what
 * happens in every small roof car park in Japan and the reason ten of the twelve
 * bays up there are 軽 bays.
 *
 * **Twelve bays, not twenty.**  The deck is 21.04 x 15.84 usable, which is two
 * 5.0 m rows either side of a 5.84 m aisle -- seven along the north parapet (one
 * of them the 3.4 m おもいやり bay) and five along the south, because the ramp's
 * own mouth takes 4.6 m out of that row and the cart return takes 2.8 m more.
 * Twenty bays needs a second aisle and a building half as big again.  (The first
 * draft of this header said fourteen, eight and six; the bay loop in `buildDeck`
 * is what the deck actually has, and `traffic.js`'s numbers index into it.)
 *
 * **The frontage faces +z and everything follows from that.**  The sun is at
 * (-52, 62, 56), so shadows fall east and south: a +z frontage is the only
 * orientation where the *wall* is lit and the apron in front of it is *also*
 * out of the building's own shadow.  Which puts the road on the north, the
 * ramp and the blank flank on the south against 湯の坂's terrace, the delivery
 * yard behind the west gable, and the pedestrian ways on the east where the
 * town is.  Four elevations, four jobs, no elevation doing two.
 *
 * **The store is served from 四丁目's lane and not from the main road.**  Its
 * head at (-3.40, 58.4) is 25 m away and there is no route: 桜守裏町's arm, its
 * 長屋 and `onsen.js`'s screen tree at (-12.8, 62.2) fill the whole corridor
 * between z = 60 and z = 66, and the tree does not move.  North of the 長屋
 * there is a clear band, so 七丁目通り leaves the district east, turns south at
 * x = -16.1 and runs east along z = 74.6 into 四丁目's lane at its north end.
 * That link costs the pocket park its south-west corner, which is recorded in
 * NEXT.md and commented in `yonchome.js`.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * FLOODFILL -- every one of these must be reachable on foot from the spawn.
 * Several are written where a *person* can stand rather than at the middle of
 * the thing they name, because a bay with a car in it and a rack with a trolley
 * rank in it are correctly unreachable -- the artefact `NEXT.md` warns about.

   * with the flight, so its coping falls 0.57 m across the 3.4 m the ivy covered.
   * Hung at one height it sat on the wall at the north end and floated up to half
   * a metre clear of it at the south, which is the whole of the complaint: a plant
   * in mid-air beside a wall reads as neither.  Each section takes the coping's
   * height at its own z, which is `surface + 0.56` for an upstand 0.62 deep set
   * 0.06 into the slab, less the `PY` the group is seated at. */
