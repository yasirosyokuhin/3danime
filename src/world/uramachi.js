/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * 桜守裏町 -- the back street behind the shrine.
 *
 * The smallest of the six blocks and the oldest thing in the new work.  Its
 * whole reason for existing is comparison: 二丁目 is render and steel and kerbs,
 * and this is timber, plaster and a gutter you step over, four hundred metres
 * away.  Neither reads as anything in particular on its own.
 *
 * It is also the piece that closes the last hole in the map.  湯の坂 comes down
 * fifteen steps onto a field and 四丁目's road head stops at a barrier, and
 * between them was thirty metres of nothing.  What goes in that gap is a lane
 * you would not find unless you were looking: it leaves the main road through a
 * 2.2 m slot beside the shrine's north wall, runs behind a screen of the onsen
 * street's trees, turns east at the top and comes out through a gap in the road
 * head's hedge.  Three ways in, none of them obvious from the others.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * THE LAND, measured.  The parcel is x -18..1, z 48..72, flat at 0.45.  What is
 * already in it:
 *
 *   湯の坂's east wall     x -18.85..-18.35, z 40.60..47.60 and 50.20..59.60,
 *                          with the fifteen steps down to the field in the gap
 *   the wall passage       x -18.60..-11.70, z 47.40..47.80 and 50.00..50.40 --
 *                          a 2.2 m slot with a wall down each side, already
 *                          built by `onsen.js` and until now leading nowhere
 *   the onsen's tree line  four grove trees at (-15.2, 52.0), (-12.8, 55.4),
 *                          (-15.2, 58.8) and (-12.8, 62.2), scale 1.35-1.55.
 *                          These are `onsen.js`'s screen -- "deep green outside
 *                          the wall, so the shelf reads as cut out of a wood" --
 *                          and **not one of them moves**.  They are the west
 *                          side of this street, which is why it has buildings
 *                          down only one side.
 *   the main road          carriageway x -6.55..-0.25 with its west footway to
 *                          x -8.10, running to `Z_MAX = 52`
 *   四丁目's road head     the carriageway carried on to z 58.40, its footways,
 *                          the barrier at 58.08..58.28 and the closing hedge at
 *                          z 59.73..60.17 running x -8.25..1.45
 *   四丁目's west hedge    x 1.48..1.92, z 58.70..61.80 and 64.60..71.40
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * WHAT THE ARITHMETIC DECIDED
 *
 * **One side only.**  The lane runs at x = -10.3 because that is the one line
 * that clears both the tree screen (which reaches x -12.17) and the road's west
 * footway (which starts at x -8.10): 2.3 m of carriageway with 0.72 m of verge
 * on the east and 0.47 m on the west.  Everything east of it as far as the road
 * is 1.05 m of leftover, so the buildings go at the *top*, where the road has
 * already stopped and there is a whole field.
 *
 * **The hedge across the road head is split for a 1.8 m gap.**  Without it this
 * block hangs off one lane with a dead end at the top, and the road head has
 * nothing beyond the barrier but planting.  With it, the end of the main road
 * has a footpath going on out of it into an older street, which is the single
 * most Japanese thing in the whole world file.  Recorded in NEXT.md.
 *
 * **The 長屋 has no setback and that is the type.**  `makeNagaya`'s eave
 * overhangs 0.92 m and its step *is* the pavement; on a 2.3 m arm that puts the
 * roof over half the street, which is exactly what a 長屋 does and the reason
 * one is worth having.  Nothing else in this world is that close to you.
 *
 * FLOODFILL -- every one of these must be reachable on foot from the spawn:
 *   slotWest   [-17.4, 48.9]  in the wall passage, at the foot of 湯の坂's steps
