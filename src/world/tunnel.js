/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * The railway tunnels -- ひばり山トンネル and 東山トンネル.
 *
 * The brief for the hills asked for one thing that is not landscape: the range
 * has to cross the railway, and the railway has to go *through* it.  That is the
 * single most recognisable image in Japanese railway scenery and it is the reason
 * the west arm exists at all -- a range that stops politely at the lineside is
 * scenery behind a town, a range the line disappears into is geography the town
 * sits inside.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * WHY THERE ARE TWO, AND WHY THEY ARE MIRRORS
 *
 * There was one, in the west arm, and the survey that this round started with
 * says it is in the wrong place: sampling `hillAt` along the whole ring, the west
 * arm carries 10-12 m of hill *north* of the track and **0.0 m** in the band
 * south of it, so the line runs along the edge of a hill rather than through one.
 * The only longitude on the planet where both flanks carry mass is the east
 * shoulder's col -- E2 at (124, -48) south of the line, E3 at (122, 20) north --
 * where the two sides read 9.9 and 9.8 at x = 123 and stay above 6 m from
 * x = 108 to 141.  So 東山トンネル goes there.
 *
 * The west bore stays, and the two are deliberately opposite at every point,
 * because two portals on a 1 005 m loop are only worth having if a player who has
 * seen one does not think they have walked back to it:
 *
 *              ひばり山トンネル (W)        東山トンネル (E)
 *   form       a spur, mass north only    a col, hill both sides
 *   approach   片切り: bank N, open S      cut on both banks
 *   bore       36 m, walkway SOUTH        30 m, walkway NORTH
 *   gate       south, x -84.5             north, x 88
 *   railside   south, at the east mouth   north, at the west mouth
 *   overlook   on the north bank          on the south ridge
 *
 * What made the second one possible is one change in `hills.js`: the drainage
 * channel's corridor closes from 14 m to 11 m over a bore's longitude, so the
 * 24 m of ground between the two rings is allowed to stand up.  Everywhere else
 * in the world that band is dead flat, which is why the first survey of it
 * returned zeros on both sides of the planet and why no range could ever have
 * crossed the line.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * WHY THE MOUNTAIN OVER THE TRACK IS NOT PART OF THE HEIGHT FIELD
 *
 * Because a height field cannot have a hole in it.  Remove faces from a
 * heightfield and what you get is a canyon from the crest to the floor, open to
 * the sky, not a tunnel; and you cannot make one vertical either, so there is no
 * way to express a portal face in it.
 *
 * So `hills.js` cuts a rectangle out of itself per bore -- `NOTCHES`, on lattice
 * lines -- and everything inside one is built here as ordinary geometry:
 *
 *   - **the cap**, a swept surface over the bore, which is the mountain;
 *   - **the two portals**, which close the cap's cut edge at each end and carry
 *     the arch;
 *   - **the bore**, an arch liner the train runs through and a player walks in;
 *   - and the cutting, the drainage, the access and the signage round them.
 *
 * Each cap samples `fieldAt` along its own four notch edges, all of which are
 * lattice lines that the notch's boundary test leaves intact, so the two surfaces
 * meet exactly rather than nearly.  Getting that wrong does not throw: it leaves
 * a hairline of sky along a ridge, forty metres long.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * THE CLEARANCE, WHICH WAS WRONG FOR THE WHOLE LIFE OF THE FIRST BORE
 *
 * `boreProfile` used to read
 *
 *     [cos(a) * T.half,  T.spring - T.half + sin(a) * T.arch]
 *                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 *
 * and the arch's centre therefore landed at y = -0.1 rather than at the
 * springing line.  The consequences, none of which threw or logged anything:
 * the crown was at **3.20 m** and not 6.5, the side walls had a height of minus
 * ten centimetres, and every one of the train's roof, its pantograph and the two
 * catenary wires ran through solid rock -- the messenger wire by 2.78 m.  It was
 * invisible because a tunnel with a train in it is a dark hole with a dark shape
 * moving in it, and because `CROWN` was computed from the *constants* (6.5) so
 * everything hung off the crown floated 2.75 m above the ceiling, inside the
 * mountain, where nothing can be seen.
 *
 * The profile is a **horseshoe**: a vertical side wall from the invert to the
 * springing at `spring`, then a quarter of an ellipse of semi-axes (`half`,
 * `arch`) centred on `(0, spring)`, so the crown lands at `spring + arch` = 6.5
 * and the two meet tangentially at `(±half, spring)`.  `boreClearance()` checks
 * it numerically against the train's own envelope from the console, and that is
 * the only way to check it -- a rendered frame of a tunnel mouth looks correct
 * whatever the ceiling is doing.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * WHAT THE ARITHMETIC DECIDED
 *
 * **36 m and 30 m of bore, and the train is 60.3 m long.**  So neither is ever
 * entirely inside, and that is the better picture: from the lineside you watch
 * the cab go in while the third car is still in the open, which is the shot.
 *
 * **The crown is at 6.5 m and it is the wires that set it, not the train.**  The
 * roof is at 3.96, the roof pods reach 4.24, the pantograph 4.88, and the
 * messenger wire above it runs at 5.95 -- and the catenary is authored as two
 * tubes right round the equator, so it goes through both tunnels whether or not a
 * real railway would hang it that way.  6.5 clears it by 0.55.  The bore is 6.6 m
 * wide because one side carries a 1.35 m maintenance walkway outside the ballast,
 * which is the brief's maintenance path, the thing that gives the mouth its scale,
 * and -- since this round -- the ground a player actually stands on.
 *
 * **The portal face is a lens, not a rectangle.**  The cap stands above the
 * hillside beside it by 11 m over the track and by nothing at all at the notch's
 * z edges, so what has to be closed at each end is the area between two profiles.
 * It is built as two extrusions split at the coping line, whose top edge is
 * `capAt` sampled at the same spacing the cap mesh uses -- so it cannot leave a
 * gap.  A single rectangular wall big enough to cover the lens would be 39 m of
 * concrete 11 m tall, which is a dam.
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ */

/**
 * The cap and the portal step at the **hill lattice's own pitch**, and that is a
 * correctness requirement rather than a tessellation preference.
 *
 * A cap has to meet the hill mesh's free edge along all four sides of its notch.
 * It does that by sampling `fieldAt` along those edges — which is exact at every
 * point it samples, and a *chord* everywhere in between.  So the two surfaces
 * agree only where the cap's stations land on lattice nodes, and where they do not
 * the cap's edge cuts the corner off the hillside's and leaves a gap open to the
 * sky along a thirty-metre line.
 *
 * It was `round(depth / 2.0)`, which gave 1.95 m in the west and 2.0 in the east
 * against a 3 m lattice: never on a node except by accident.  Measured, with the
 * lattice at 1.5 m: **1.69 m of gap** at 東山's south edge and 0.96 at ひばり山's
 * east one.  It threw nothing and it is invisible from anywhere except a position
 * that happens to look along the edge, which is why it survived two rounds of the
 * cap being rewritten.
 *
 * Every notch edge is a multiple of `CELL` (that is enforced in `hills.js` and is
 * why the lattice may only be halved, never divided by 2.0), so both counts below
 * are exact integers and every boundary vertex of the cap is a lattice node.

 * 法枠工 -- the crib on the cut faces.

/**
 * The one thing every Japanese railway cutting has and this one did not.
 *
 * The measurement that asks for it: `plantRange` rejects any candidate on ground
 * steeper than 0.9, and **every engineered face in this world is steeper than
 * that by construction** -- `slopeLimitAt` allows 1.9 inside the two ring
 * corridors on purpose, because a cutting is steep and that is what a cutting is.
 * So the approach banks, the col's ridge and the knoll's flanks were the only
 * places in the world with nothing on them at all, and `faceTone` painted the lot
 * `hillEarth`: 45 % of the overlook's frame, 60 % of the gate's and a third of the
 * railside spot's, in one flat tan.
 *
 * `dressFaces` scatters scrub over them and it is not the answer, for the reason
 * the brief gives: the problem is not that the face is empty, it is that the face
 * has **no scale and no evidence of anybody** on it.  Sixty more shrubs is sixty
 * more objects of unknown size on an unknown slope.  A 2 m grid of shallow
 * concrete beams with grass in the cells gives it both at once -- a module the eye
 * can count, and the unmistakable mark of a cutting that was cut rather than a
 * hillside that happens to be steep.
 *
 * Three things are load-bearing and none of them is obvious:
 *
 *   - **The rows are spaced along the slope, not in plan.**  A face here runs at
 *     1.55-1.9, so a 2.2 m plan spacing is 3.6-4.4 m of actual concrete and the
 *     grid comes out as letterbox cells that get taller as the bank steepens.
 *     Each column is *marched* outward from the toe accumulating arc length, and a
 *     row goes in every 2.2 m of it.  Which also means a column carries as many
 *     rows as its own bank is long, so the frame simply stops where the bank dies
 *     instead of being stretched over it.
 *   - **A beam that runs across the slope is not as wide as its plan width.**  Lay
 *     a contour beam 0.34 m wide in plan on a 1.9 face and it is 0.74 m wide on
 *     the ground -- twice the section, and the cells shrink to match.  The plan
 *     half-width is divided by `hypot(1, g·n)`, the directional derivative across
 *     the beam, so every member is 0.34 m on the slope whichever way it runs.
 *     Exactly the same class of error as a raked stair's `rake`: the geometry has
 *     to be derived from the surface, not written in the plane and hoped for.
 *   - **The cells are re-skinned green.**  The crib is `植生基材吹付` -- the cells
 *     are seeded, and the whole point of a green face inside a concrete frame is
 *     that it is not tan.  Laying the infill as one lifted surface with a skirt is
 *     the same construction `hillPath` uses, for the same reason: 45 mm of
 *     clearance and a 0.30 m skirt is honest where a facet bulges, and a bare
 *     plane at the same height would z-fight.
 *
 * Deliberately **not** here: the 練石積み / ブロック積み toe wall the brief offers
 * as an option.  There is already 0.55 m of retaining kerb and a lined channel
 * along the foot of every one of these faces, so a two-metre block band above it
 * would read as a wall with a hillside behind it -- and it would eat the bottom
 * third of the very area the crib is here to stop being tan.  What the toe gets
 * instead is a heavier 小口止め beam, which is what actually holds a crib down.
 *
 * Nothing here casts a shadow.  A 0.19 m step is one or two texels at this
 * cascade and its own shadow lands as a row of sawtooth triangles along the face
 * rather than as a line -- the same call `wallRun` makes for a thin coping.  The
 * beams read entirely off their own side faces, which are near vertical against a
 * 1.6 slope and therefore two cel bands away from it.

   * points are lattice **nodes** rather than edges, and a cone's error falls only
   * linearly with the spacing.  Which is why this was measured at four values
   * rather than derived at one.
   *
   * 0.18 costs about 30 k triangles against 16 k at 0.25, and that is the right
   * trade here: the whole crib is four baked, frustum-culled draw calls, and this
