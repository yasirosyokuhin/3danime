/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * 川端の道 -- the lane between the canal and the school's back wall.
 *
 * The largest single piece of empty ground left anywhere near the middle of the
 * map: 36 m by 10.6 m, dead flat at 1.05, with water down one side and 2.35 m of
 * school wall down the other.  Nothing had ever been built on it because it is
 * *behind* everything -- behind the school, behind the house on the 通学路,
 * across the canal from the crossing -- and the only ways in are two slots
 * either side of that house, 0.82 m and 0.94 m of walkable ground each.
 *
 * That is the whole character of the street and it is why it is a lane and not
 * a road: **nothing with four wheels can get here.**  So the buildings are the
 * types that never needed a car -- a 長屋, a 木造平屋, a 連棟 二戸, a 二階半 and
 * an old two-storey timber house -- and what would be a carriageway anywhere
 * else is 2.8 m of worn asphalt with a gutter down one side.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * THE LAND, measured.  Envelope x 19.4..56.0, z -30.2..-40.8:
 *
 *   north   the canal's retaining kerb, z -30.20..-29.84, top 1.27, running
 *           x 10.45..44.00 -- **and stopping there.**  `canal.js` runs its
 *           structure the whole way round the planet and its *dressing* only
 *           over x -58..44, so east of x = 44 the water's edge is a bare 0.40 m
 *           drop onto the towpath with nothing at all along it.  That is the
 *           single most load-bearing fact about this site and the reason the
 *           first thing built here is a railing.
 *   south   the school's north wall, x 10.60..56.00 at z -41.00, 2.35 m of
 *           block with mesh to 3.45 (`school.js`, `Z_S`/`X_W`/`X_E`)
 *   east    the school's east wall turns north at x 55.9 and runs to z -74
 *   west    the house at (14.4,-35.5), x 10.80..18.00, z -39.30..-31.70, with
 *           a 1.5 m slot north of it and a 1.62 m slot south
 *   in it   one grove tree, `canal.js`'s at (28.6, -34.2) at scale 1.8, whose
 *           collider is x 27.87..29.33, z -34.93..-33.47
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * WHAT THE ARITHMETIC DECIDED
 *
 * **The lane is at z = -32.2 because of that one tree.**  At -32.6, where a
 * 2.8 m carriageway wants to be to leave 7 m of plot, the tree's collider comes
 * 0.53 m into the south verge.  -32.2 clears it by 0.13 m and still leaves
 * 7.2 m of plot depth, which is a 1.7 m front garden and a 5.0 m building.  The
 * tree stays: it is the canal's own south-bank mass, and standing it in a break
 * in the row instead gives it a better job than it had.
 *
 * **The frontages face +z, into the canal.**  The sun is at (-52, 62, 56), so a
 * +z elevation is the warm one -- 四丁目 and 二丁目 both record it.  Facing the
 * water is therefore also facing the light, which is the whole reason a lane
 * like this is worth building: five sunlit frontages with the channel in front
 * of them and a blank wall behind you.
 *
 * **The way down to the water is at the far end, and it is a ramp.**  There is
 * a flight at こばと橋 already (`gakkomae.js`) and a second one would be the
 * same beat twice; and east of x = 44 there is no kerb to cut through, so a
 * 1:11 ramp lies straight on the bank.  It is also the only bicycle-friendly
 * way onto the towpath in the world.
 *
 * FLOODFILL -- every one of these must be reachable on foot from the spawn:
 *   slotNorth  [14.6, -30.9]  the 1.5 m slot north of the house, the way in
 *   slotSouth  [14.6, -40.1]  the 1.62 m slot south of it
