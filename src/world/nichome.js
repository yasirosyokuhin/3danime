/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * ひばり台二丁目 -- the newer half of the district, east of the overbridge.
 *
 * Everything west of the crossing was built before the war and looks it.  This
 * is the other side of the same town: land that was paddy until somebody sold
 * it in one piece, so the plots are regular, the street has kerbs and edge
 * lines, and the buildings are render and steel rather than timber and tile.
 * It is the only block in the world that is *planned*, and that is its whole
 * job -- 一丁目 and 桜守裏町 only read as old because there is somewhere newer
 * to compare them with.
 *
 * It is also the block with a road in it rather than a lane, and the four
 * things nobody travels to: the clinic, the pharmacy, the coin laundry and the
 * estate agent.  `textures.js` has carried their fascias since the shopping
 * street was built and nothing had ever placed them; every one is a near-white
 * ground with one thin bar, deliberately, because a clinic that shouts is a
 * clinic nobody trusts and because さくら坂 is two streets away and must stay
 * the loudest thing in the district.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * THE LAND, measured rather than assumed -- the 四丁目 lesson.  The envelope is
 * x 47.2..70, z 5..46, and what is already in it is:
 *
 *   the railway masking wall  z 4.60..5.00, top 2.20, running x 46 -> 118 with
 *                             its pier at x 45.47..46.09 (`railway.js`).  The
 *                             block's south boundary, and a hard one.
 *   公園前's link             a 2.2 m footway at z 15.15..17.35 running east to
 *                             x 47.35 -- "block 2's spine kerb".  This block
 *                             exists partly to give that link somewhere to
 *                             arrive (`koenmae.js`).
 *   公園前's 木造平屋         x 43.45..47.25, z 6.25..11.65, with its boundary
 *                             at z 11.91..12.19.  Its back wall is this
 *                             street's west edge for eight metres.
 *   児童公園's east railing   x 43.6, z 17.4..30.6 (`district.js`)
 *   公園前's service strip    x 42.9..47.3, z 35.0..43.4 -- ひばり荘's back
 *   the north lane's east arm x 40..48.6, z 43.5..46.9 (`northblock.js`), and
 *                             the boundary walls at x 47.6..49.0 / z 45.9..46.1
 *                             and x 48.9..49.1 / z 46.0..47.9
 *   片流れの平屋             x 42.90..48.70, z 47.80..53.40
 *   the guide sign            x 51.52..52.08, z 16.52..17.08, top 3.32 -- the
 *                             こ線橋 板 the link arrives past.  It stands in the
 *                             middle of what would otherwise be the T, so the
 *                             junction is laid round it.
 *
 * The ground is dead flat at y = 0 as far as z = 30 and then climbs to 0.45 by
 * z = 48, which the `lane` sweep follows for free; relief starts at about
 * x = 72, so nothing is built east of x = 70.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * WHAT THE ARITHMETIC DECIDED
 *
 * **The spine runs the full 38 m and it is kerbed.**  It is the only new street
 * that joins two existing ones at both ends -- 公園前's link at z 16.25 and the
 * north lane's east arm at z 45.2 -- so it is a through route, and a through
 * route in this world gets kerbs, edge lines, gullies and a mirror.  The back
 * lanes deliberately have none of that, and the difference is the grammar: on
 * さくら坂裏路地 or 一丁目 the surface *is* the boundary, here there is a kerb
 * between you and the traffic.
 *
 * **Everything is on the east side.**  The west side is spoken for over its
 * whole length -- the 木造's back, then the park's railing, then ひばり荘's
 * service strip -- so a street with frontage on both sides was never available.
 * That turns out to be the best thing about it: you walk north with buildings
 * on your right and the park open on your left for thirteen metres, which is
 * the one place in the district where a street has a view *out* of it.
 *
 * **The park gets an east gate.**  `district.js` fenced 児童公園 on all four
 * sides with one opening, on the west, which was correct when there was nothing
 * east of it and is wrong now that a street runs down that side.  The east
 * railing is split for a 1.6 m gate at z 23.4..25.0 and the run ends in posts.
 * Recorded in NEXT.md with the rest of the nudges to existing content.
 *
 * **The far east is not built on.**  Past x = 66 the block becomes 貸農園 --
 * allotment beds, a tin store, a standpipe -- and then hedge, and then the
 * hills start.  An estate that ends in a straight line of identical back fences
 * reads as a render; one that ends in vegetables reads as a town.
 *
 * FLOODFILL -- every one of these must be reachable on foot from the spawn:
 *   spineS     [49.2,  8.0]   the south end, at the railway wall
 *   parkYard   [56.0, 11.6]   the 月極 car park's aisle
