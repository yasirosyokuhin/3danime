/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * 用水路 -- the drainage channel.
 *
 * Every Japanese suburb has one of these: a concrete-lined watercourse
 * running dead straight behind the houses, with a two-metre service path
 * either side that everybody uses as a shortcut.  It earns its place here
 * for three reasons.
 *
 *  - It is the only *open* space in the world.  Everywhere else is closed by
 *    frontage; this is a straight line and low planting for as far as you can
 *    see, which is what makes the rest read as dense.
 *  - It is across the tracks, so getting to it means going through the level
 *    crossing.  The world gets bigger by using what is already there.
 *  - From the footbridge you look back up a two-metre slot between two
 *    houses at the railway.  A train crossing that slot for half a second is
 *    worth more than any amount of open sight line.
 *
 * It now circles the planet, exactly like the railway and for exactly the
 * same reason: authored as a straight line of constant z spanning one full
 * circumference in x, the equirectangular bake closes it into a seamless
 * latitude circle.  Three things follow from that, and all three are the
 * reason this file looks the way it does:
 *
 *  - **The civil works run the whole way round; the dressing does not.**
 *    Revetment, bed, coping, bank slabs, service paths and water go all the
 *    way; railings, planting, reeds, furniture and signage stop at `D_W` and
 *    `D_E`.  Same division as `railway.js`: track everywhere, station and
 *    fencing only where the district is.
 *  - **The bank slabs are what seal the excavation**, and the excavation is
 *    now a continuous band right round the world (`landform.js`).  Any gap
 *    left in the slabs is a hole through the planet, so every gap has to be
 *    filled by something else -- which is what the road bridge is for.
 *  - **The street crosses it.**  That is not optional: a ring at z = -24 has
 *    to meet a road running along z somewhere.  The made ground is dead flat
 *    at `Y0` because the natural grade falls three quarters of a metre across
 *    the corridor, and the carriageway is *not* flat -- it climbs 0.64 m over
 *    the twelve metres of bank.  So every bank layer stops for the road and
 *    こばと橋 takes over: graded fill either side, a deck over the channel,
 *    parapets, edge upstands, and two steps where the south bank drops onto
 *    the apron.
 *
 * The channel is a genuine excavation -- see `landform.js` for the hole it
 * needs in the terrain grid and the planet sphere, and `index.js` for the
 * matching *cut* in the height query, without which the player walks the
 * north bank floating a quarter of a metre above it.
 *
 * The water, by contrast, is unashamedly a stylisation: flat blocks of sky,
 * a scatter of petals, and a pale streak in the train's own colours that
 * sweeps the surface as it passes.  The train is twenty-four metres away
 * behind two rows of houses, so an argued reflection would be nothing at
 * all; a painted one is the whole point of the shot.

/**
 * **The channel is a reach between two ranges, not a ring.**
 *
 * It was one exact circumference so that the equirectangular bake closed it with
 * no seam, the same trick the railway still uses.  What that produced once
 * `hills.js` existed was a flat 28 m corridor sawn clean through ひばり山 at both
 * tunnel longitudes -- the range 9-10 m high either side, dead level in between,
 * and a bare concrete channel down the middle of the gap.  It is now bounded to
 * the reach between the two ranges, and `hills.js` closes its corridor everywhere
 * else so the hills join over the line they used to be cut by.
 *
 * The two numbers live in `landform.js` because the *hole* is the thing that has
 * to agree with them, and the hills read them from there too.  Every layer below
 * that used to run the full ring now runs this reach; everything that was already
 * bounded to the dressed stretch is untouched.
 *
 * `X_MID` matters: the revetment, the bed and the water surface are single boxes
 * `L` long, and they were centred on x = 0 because a ring centred anywhere else
 * is the same ring.  A reach is not -- leave them at 0 and the whole channel is
 * drawn 4 m out of position, which is the one silent way to get this wrong.

 * levels it has to reconcile are three quarters of a metre apart and neither
 * of them can move: the bank is flat at Y0 because a canal is flat, and the
 * road climbs through the corridor on its way to the school.  So the bank
 * stops and the road carries on over the water:
 *
 *   fill    z -30.0 .. -26.3 and -21.7 .. -17.2, top at the natural grade,
 *           deep enough to seal the excavation the terrain lost
 *   deck    z -26.6 .. -21.4, 0.42 m thick, soffit half a metre over the
 *           water at the south lip and 0.8 at the north
 *   parapet the trench footprint exactly, z -27.4 .. -20.6
 *   upstand along both outer edges of the deck, because a 0.42 m drop into a
 *           channel needs an edge and a 0.25 m kerb is inside a step height
 *   steps   two, at each end of the south path, which arrives 0.34 m above
 *           the apron
 *
 * Nothing here is registered as a platform: the deck top is deliberately at
 * the terrain grade (`GRADE`, i.e. `TERRAIN_DROP` under the reference plane and
 * under the asphalt that runs over it), so the existing height query already
 * answers correctly over the whole bridge.

 * each end is a culvert mouth set in the toe of the closing range, and what is on
 * the far side of it is the hill.
 *
 * **The two are deliberately not the same structure**, the same argument
 * `hills.js` makes about its two portals: a player who has walked one end of the
 * channel must not think they have walked back to the other.  The tell here is
 * function rather than light --
 *
 *   西 (x = -98)  **呑口**, the inlet.  The channel *ends* here and the water goes
 *                 in, so it gets the thing only an inlet has: a raked 除塵
 *                 スクリーン across the mouth with a rake stood beside it, a
 *                 maintenance platform on the north bank and a gauge board.
 *                 Concrete, square, and recent.
 *   東 (x = 106)  **吐口**, and it is also the reach's source.  Water comes *out*,
 *                 so there is nothing across it -- a screen on an outlet is
 *                 nonsense -- and it is the older work: a stone-faced arch, a
 *                 mossy sill, a stilling apron with a lip, and reeds at the mouth
 *                 where the flow slows.
 *
 * **Built as blocks round the opening, never as a hole in a box.**  You cannot
 * carve a recess into a `BoxGeometry`, which is the trap the onsen street's 格子
 * panels and the library's window plates each cost a round: two side blocks and a
 * header, with the reveal and the dark of the barrel built *outward* off them.
 *
 * The wall's outer face sits exactly on the trench bound, which is what closes the
 * excavation's own void: `landform.js` stops cutting at `CANAL_X0`/`CANAL_X1`, but
 * the revetment and the bed run `END_TAIL` further to seal the hole's overshoot,
 * so behind each headwall there are three metres of channel with no ground over
